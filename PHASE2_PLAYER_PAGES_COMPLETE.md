# Phase 2: Player History Pages with Shadcn UI Charts - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully built comprehensive player history pages with beautiful Shadcn UI charts, integrated navigation from the roster, and provided a seamless user experience for viewing player progression data.

## What Was Built

### 1. Shadcn UI Installation & Configuration
- ✅ Installed Shadcn UI with default settings
- ✅ Added Chart component (uses Recharts under the hood)
- ✅ Added Card component for beautiful containers
- ✅ Configured with dark mode support

### 2. Chart Components (Using Shadcn UI)
Created three specialized chart components following Shadcn UI design patterns:

#### **TrophyChart** (`/app/web-next/src/components/player/TrophyChart.tsx`)
- Displays regular trophies and ranked trophies over time
- Dual-line chart with yellow (regular) and blue (ranked) lines
- Card-based layout with Trophy icon
- Responsive design

#### **DonationChart** (`/app/web-next/src/components/player/DonationChart.tsx`)
- Shows donations given vs. received over time
- Dual-line chart with green (donated) and pink (received) lines
- Card-based layout with Heart icon
- Tracks clan generosity

#### **HeroProgressionChart** (`/app/web-next/src/components/player/HeroProgressionChart.tsx`)
- Multi-line chart tracking all 4 heroes (BK, AQ, GW, RC)
- Color-coded: Orange (BK), Pink (AQ), Blue (GW), Purple (RC)
- Wider chart for better visibility
- Shows level progression over time

### 3. Player History Page
Created `/app/web-next/src/app/player/[tag]/history/page.tsx`:
- **Header Section**: Back button, player tag, data range info
- **Charts Grid**: 2-column layout (Trophy + Donation)
- **Full-Width Hero Chart**: Expanded view for hero progression
- **Data Source Footer**: Shows data source and settings
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### 4. Navigation Integration
Updated `/app/web-next/src/app/simple-roster/page.tsx`:
- Changed player name links from `/simple-player/[tag]` to `/player/[tag]/history`
- Works in both desktop table view and mobile card view
- Player names are now clickable links to their history pages

## Features

- ✅ Handles missing data gracefully

### User Experience
- ✅ Back button to return to roster
- ✅ Smooth navigation from roster table
- ✅ Responsive charts that adapt to container

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Direct URL Access
```
URL: http://localhost:3000/player/UU9GJ9QQ/history
```
✅ **Result**: Page loads successfully with all 3 charts displaying historical data

### Test 2: Navigation from Roster

### Test 4: Data Variety
- Player 1 (#UU9GJ9QQ): 56 data points - stable trophies, low donations
- Player 2 (#VGQVRLRL): 56 data points - varying trophies, active donations

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Installed
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "recharts": "^3.2.0",  // Already present
    "lucide-react": "^0.452.0",  // Already present
    "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.1",  // Added by Shadcn
    "clsx": "^2.1.1",  // Added by Shadcn
    "tailwind-merge": "^2.5.5"  // Added by Shadcn
  }
}
```

### Files Created
1. `/app/web-next/src/components/player/TrophyChart.tsx` - Trophy progression chart
2. `/app/web-next/src/components/player/DonationChart.tsx` - Donation activity chart
3. `/app/web-next/src/components/player/HeroProgressionChart.tsx` - Hero progression chart
4. `/app/web-next/src/app/player/[tag]/history/page.tsx` - Main history page
5. `/app/web-next/src/components/ui/card.tsx` - Shadcn UI Card component
6. `/app/web-next/src/components/ui/chart.tsx` - Shadcn UI Chart wrapper
7. `/app/web-next/components.json` - Shadcn UI configuration

### Files Modified
1. `/app/web-next/src/app/simple-roster/page.tsx` - Updated player name links (2 locations)
2. `/app/web-next/tailwind.config.js` - Enhanced by Shadcn UI
3. `/app/web-next/src/app/globals.css` - CSS variables added by Shadcn UI
4. `/app/web-next/src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility function for className merging

## Chart Configuration

Each chart uses `ChartConfig` from Shadcn UI:
```typescript
const chartConfig = {
  trophies: {
    label: 'Regular Trophies',
    color: 'hsl(48, 96%, 53%)', // Yellow
  },
  rankedTrophies: {
    label: 'Ranked Trophies',
    color: 'hsl(217, 91%, 60%)', // Blue
  },
} satisfies ChartConfig;
```

This enables:
- Automatic theme support
- Consistent color scheme
- Proper tooltip labeling
- CSS variable integration

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
- Add date range selector (7d, 30d, 60d, 90d)
- Add export chart as image feature
- Add milestone markers (TH upgrades, major achievements)
- Add comparison view (compare 2 players side-by-side)
- Add war statistics if data becomes available
- Add activity score chart

## Performance Notes
- Charts are client-side rendered (`'use client'`)
- Data fetching happens server-side
- No caching for fresh data (`revalidate: 0`)
- Responsive container handles all screen sizes
- Efficient rendering with Recharts

## API Integration
Uses the enhanced history API from Phase 1:
- Endpoint: `/api/player/[tag]/history?days=30`
- Returns: Comprehensive historical data with deltas
- Supports: Up to 365 days of history
- Data source: Dual support (new + legacy tables)

## User Workflow
1. User views roster at `/simple-roster`
2. User clicks on any player name (yellow text)
3. History page loads with 3 charts
4. User can click back arrow to return to roster
5. All data is fetched fresh on each visit

## Conclusion
Phase 2 successfully delivers a complete player history viewing experience with professional Shadcn UI charts. The integration is seamless, the design is clean, and the data visualization effectively communicates player progression across multiple metrics.
