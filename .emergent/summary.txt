The AI engineer started by summarizing initial development, then confirmed a plan with the user. Key tasks completed include refining the activity scoring logic in , updating thresholds based on user feedback, and implementing comprehensive tooltips on the  page. Extensive UI redesigns for mobile cards were performed, including reordering elements, incorporating Clash Display font for names, adjusting icon sizes (TH, League, Trophy), and removing excessive styling from roles and activity levels. The trophy icon was added and integrated into both desktop and mobile views. TypeScript errors related to  and hero tooltip null checks were resolved. Table headers were made sortable with visible tooltips, and Unranked was changed to Inactive. Finally, the user clarified the product vision for historical data and player pages, leading the AI to document the original dashboard and begin analyzing the existing player history API endpoint.

The application is a Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript dashboard providing Clash of Clans clan management analytics. Initial user requests focused on bug fixes (Player Profile Crash, Card View Crash, Infinite Loop, Ranked League Icons, Preview Window issues). A major pivot simplified the Roster Table and Player Profile Page to a backend-driven data flow. User feedback emphasized restoring the original dashboard's look and feel, including sorting, rush percentage, and activity status, with default sorting by ranked league and trophies. Subsequent UI requests involved larger league badges, white numbers, removing the theme toggle, reordering columns, and fixing the clan name display. The current vision prioritizes historical views on dedicated player pages (trophy, war, donations, heroes, activity history), automated daily data ingestion, and a simplified navigation. The goal is to help clan leaders make informed decisions by tracking member activity and progression.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on laying the groundwork for historical player pages. The user explicitly requested to get the player pages fully fleshed out and also to kill the original roster page.

The AI has successfully:
1. Documented the features of the old dashboard in  for future reference.
2. Redirected the main application page () to the simplified roster page ().
3. Confirmed the existence of , an API endpoint that is intended to serve player historical data.

The current state is that the  API endpoint exists but its functionality for retrieving and structuring historical data from Supabase needs to be developed or enhanced. The AI is currently inspecting this existing endpoint to understand its current state before proceeding with its enhancement.
