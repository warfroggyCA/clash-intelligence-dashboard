The AI engineer's work initiated a critical pivot from a complex, unstable Clash of Clans Intelligence Dashboard, plagued by React rendering infinite loops, to a simplified, backend-driven architecture. This involved creating new  and  pages. Early efforts successfully addressed a 502 error in the preview environment by implementing an Nginx proxy to correctly route Next.js API calls, establishing a stable foundation.

Subsequent work meticulously enhanced the UI of these simplified pages to mirror the original application's sophisticated look, integrating authentic game assets for Town Hall and League icons, and ensuring full mobile responsiveness. The most recent and challenging phase focused on debugging data accuracy, particularly for player ranked leagues, rush percentages, and activity statuses. This iterative process unveiled issues with hero data persistence, sorting logic, and a fundamental discrepancy between in-game ranked league visibility and the Clash of Clans API's data. The current investigation pinpointed an incomplete TypeScript definition for the  type, preventing the correct ingestion of  from the clan member summary API, which is crucial for accurate roster badge display.

The application, a Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript dashboard with Supabase and Tailwind CSS, provides Clash of Clans clan management analytics. Initially, the user requested a codebase review and bug fixes for:
1.  **Player Profile Crash**: Incorrect data loading, browser back crashes, and  errors.
2.  **Card View Crash**: Infinite loop on switching to card view.
3.  **Systemic Infinite Loop Pattern**: Persistent re-renders due to Zustand and  in various components.
4.  **Ranked League Icons**: Icons not appearing on player profiles.
5.  **Preview Window Functionality**: Application not displaying correctly in the Emergent preview window due to port/sign-in issues.
6.  **Simplified Architecture**: Later, a major pivot to simplify the Roster Table and Player Profile Page architecture, moving to a backend-driven data flow where the frontend is purely for presentation.
The user later requested to match the *look and feel* of the original sophisticated dashboard, and then to add essential features like **sorting**, **rush percentage**, and **activity status** visible on all views, with specific logic for default sorting by ranked league and trophy count. The latest user feedback identified discrepancies in ranked league display based on actual in-game status, demanding truthful and accurate data presentation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in resolving a critical data accuracy issue related to displaying ranked league badges. The user reported that certain players, despite showing a  in their Clash of Clans API profile and our database, were not displaying a ranked badge in the actual in-game roster.

Initial attempts to differentiate active participation using  or  as proxies proved unsuccessful, as these fields did not align with the user's in-game observations for specific players (e.g., Andrew had  in raw API but still showed a league badge in our system, while other  players should have badges). A detailed document on Clash of Clans ranked battle mechanics was provided, emphasizing  and  as key indicators, and highlighting the distinction from legacy trophies.

Through direct  comparisons with the raw Clash of Clans API and deep inspection of database fields and ingestion logic, it was discovered that the  API endpoint contains the accurate  ( for unranked players) which directly correlates with the in-game roster badge display. However, the current ingestion process in  was incorrectly using  (from the individual player detail API, which seems to contain enrolled league status rather than participating) and, more critically, the  type definition in  is incomplete, leading to the accurate  data from the clan member summary being dropped.

The current state is that the frontend logic for displaying ranked badges is based on potentially incorrect or incomplete  data due to this ingestion and typing issue, causing a mismatch between the application and the actual in-game roster display.
