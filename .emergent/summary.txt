The AI engineer's work began with a thorough codebase review and bug analysis of a Clash of Clans Intelligence Dashboard. Critical issues identified included a player profile data loading bug, browser back navigation crashes, a card view crash, and a systemic React rendering infinite loop pattern () caused by Zustand state management and  dependencies.

The AI engineer systematically tackled these, starting with an RCA for the player profile issue, which led to identifying missing Supabase credentials and an incorrect snapshot selection logic ( vs. ). Subsequently, the ranked league icon issue was resolved by updating data structures and UI components.

The React 185 error proved persistent, leading to multiple attempts to fix  dependencies, implement Zustand's  comparison, and temporarily disable problematic components like  and . Frustration with the persistent complexity ultimately led to a strategic decision to rebuild the core Roster Table and Player Profile pages with a simplified, backend-driven architecture. The current work involves implementing these simplified pages and addressing initial data loading errors for them.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a thorough codebase review and a plan of attack, specifically highlighting documented bugs like  and .
The application is a full-stack Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript application with a Supabase (PostgreSQL) backend, Zustand for state, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It provides analytics for Clash of Clans clan management.

Key issues identified and requested to be fixed:
1.  **Player Profile Crash:** Incorrect player data loading, and browser back button crashes (). This includes tag normalization issues, Supabase query failures, and  field population.
2.  **Card View Crash:** Immediate crash when switching to card view due to a Zustand/React rendering infinite loop.
3.  **Systemic Infinite Loop Pattern:** An architectural issue where Zustand creates new object/array references, leading to infinite re-renders in  dependencies across , , , and .
4.  **Ranked League Icons:** Ranked league icons were not showing on player profile pages.
5.  **Preview Window Functionality:** The application was not displaying correctly in the Emergent preview window due to incorrect port configuration and a mandatory sign-in.
6.  **Simplified Architecture:** A later request to simplify the app's architecture, focusing on the Roster Table and Player Profile Page, by having the backend provide fully processed data and the frontend solely handling presentation, moving away from complex frontend state management.

<pending_tasks>
- **Card View Crash:** The feature is still disabled () and not fixed, only worked around.
- **Browser Back Navigation Crash:** Despite attempts to add cleanup on unmount for player profiles, the error persisted, leading to a decision to rebuild.
- ** Endpoint:** This API endpoint was noted to be failing (500 error) in the initial analysis but has not been addressed.
- **Complete Rebuild of UI:** The simple architecture is currently only implemented for the roster and player profile pages, and the integration is ongoing.

<current_work>
The immediate work involved a significant architectural shift to address persistent Maximum update depth exceeded (React 185) errors and general frontend complexity. The previous attempts to fix specific  dependencies and integrate  comparison were unsuccessful in fully resolving the stability issues.

The AI engineer decided to adopt a new strategy: rebuilding the core  and  with a simplified, backend-driven data flow, where the frontend is purely for presentation.

Two new pages were created:
1.  : Designed to display the roster with a simpler data fetching and rendering approach.
2.  : Designed for simplified player profile display.

A prominent green button was added to the  to provide a direct link to the new  page for testing.

Currently, when the user clicks this green button, the new  page attempts to load but encounters a **502 error**. An  command to the  endpoint confirmed that the backend API itself is functioning correctly and returning data. The problem lies in a **format mismatch**: the API returns nested data, but the newly created  page is expecting a flatter data structure, causing the rendering failure. The AI engineer is in the process of adapting the  page to correctly consume this nested API response.

Adapt the  component to correctly process the nested data structure returned by the  endpoint.
