  - [ ] Move `RosterStatsPanel` and `RosterHighlightsPanel` content into the roster tab
  - [ ] Ensure leadership-only actions remain accessible (modals, quick departures)
  - [ ] Surface snapshot metadata (last load info) in the roster header

- [ ] **Insights Tab**
  - [ ] Create a unified ‚ÄúInsights‚Äù tab combining Smart Insights headlines, change summaries, and action items
  - [ ] Reuse `selectors.smartInsights*`, `historyByClan`, and `lastLoadInfo` for data
  - [ ] Provide clear empty/error states so the tab degrades gracefully when data is missing

- [ ] **Tab Visibility**
  - [ ] Hide placeholder tabs (Events, Applicants, Intelligence) unless data is production-ready
  - [ ] Enforce role-based visibility per planning so leadership tools only show for leaders
  - [ ] Update `getVisibleTabs` and `TabNavigation` to reflect the new rules

## Smart Insights Consolidation (Work In Progress)

### Current ‚ÄúAI‚Äù Feature Inventory
- **Coaching advice** (`AICoaching` panel, `/api/ai-coaching/generate`, `ai-processor.generateCoachingAdvice`) ‚Äì personalized tips + ready-to-paste chat.
- **Change summaries** (`ChangeDashboard`, quick actions ‚ÄúGenerate Summary‚Äù, `/api/ai-summary/generate`, `ai-summarizer.generateChangeSummary`) ‚Äì narrative digest of roster deltas.
- **Snapshot headlines** (`QuickActions` snapshot copy, `ai-storage.generateSnapshotSummary`) ‚Äì text summary injected into clipboard/export flows.
- **Player DNA insights** (`PlayerDNADashboard`, `/api/ai/dna-cache`, `ai-processor.generatePlayerDNAInsights`) ‚Äì ‚Äúarchetype‚Äù cards for members.
- **Clan DNA overview** (`PlayerDNADashboard` overview, `ai-processor.generateClanDNAInsights`) ‚Äì health/weakness callouts.
- **Game chat blurbs** (`FullSnapshotDashboard`, `ai-processor.generateGameChatMessages`) ‚Äì optional templated shout-outs.
- **Nightly batch pipeline** (`cron/daily-snapshot`, `ai-processor.processBatchAI`, Supabase `batch_ai_results`) ‚Äì orchestrates all of the above and caches outputs.
- **Force-refresh flow** (`/api/admin/force-refresh`, Settings modal) ‚Äì on-demand snapshot & insights run.

### Pain Points
- Multiple prompts/pipelines create inconsistent tone and brittle parsing.
- UI labels scream ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, scattered across tabs so failures feel pervasive.
- Insights buried in separate panels instead of a single ‚ÄúWhat matters now‚Äù feed.
- Storage duplication (Supabase + localStorage + ad hoc copies) complicates refresh/fallback logic.

### Consolidation Direction
1. **Rename + Reframe**
   - Replace ‚ÄúAI Coaching‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI Summary‚Äù, etc. with ‚ÄúSmart Insights‚Äù, ‚ÄúCoaching‚Äù, ‚ÄúDaily Headlines‚Äù.
   - Audit copy for ‚ÄúAI‚Äù references and switch to value-focused language (‚ÄúAutomatic insights‚Äù, ‚ÄúDaily highlights‚Äù).

2. **Single Insights Service**
   - Promote `ai-processor` to `smart-insights-service` with one orchestrator that produces a typed payload:
     ```ts
     interface SmartInsightsPayload {
       headlines: Headline[];        // surfaced on dashboard
       coaching: Recommendation[];   // actionable items
       playerSpotlights: Spotlight[];// optional individual cards
       diagnostics: InsightMeta;     // timestamps, health flags
     }
     ```
   - Internally reuse shared prompt builders for snapshot context + roster stats.
   - Persist a single JSON blob per snapshot (Supabase + local cache) instead of per-feature arrays.

3. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Add ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Headlines‚Äù section to the main dashboard header/body fed by `payload.headlines`.
   - Feature limited actionable cards (top 3 coaching tips) with ‚ÄúView more insights‚Äù link.
   - Move detailed player DNA + clan archetype views under expandable ‚ÄúDeep Dive‚Äù modal fed from same payload.

4. **Resilient Fallbacks**
   - Centralize error handling in service; when generation fails, serve last known payload + ‚ÄúStale insight‚Äù badge.
   - Continue nightly cron, but allow manual refresh to only regenerate missing pieces.

### Immediate Tasks (Suggested Order)
1. **Terminology sweep** ‚Äì search/replace UI copy to drop ‚ÄúAI‚Äù branding; update navigation labels, button text, toasts.
2. **Define `SmartInsightsPayload`** ‚Äì schema + type in `lib/smart-insights.ts`; adapt batch runner to emit it while still backfilling current consumers.
3. **Build dashboard headlines section** ‚Äì surface top 3 highlights in `ClientDashboard` with fallback messaging when payload stale.
4. **Adapter layer** ‚Äì shim existing components (coaching panel, DNA dashboard) to read from unified payload before full refactor.
5. **Deprecate legacy endpoints** ‚Äì once adapters migrated, collapse `/api/ai-*` routes into `/api/insights/*`.

### Open Questions
- Do we keep player DNA calculations if no OpenAI key is present (pure heuristics vs. removal)?
- Should coaching/chat messages remain shareable to Discord, and if so, what‚Äôs the preferred format post-consolidation?
- How fresh do ‚ÄúHeadlines‚Äù need to be (live refresh vs. nightly snapshot)?

## Access Management
- [ ] **Role inheritance** from login (remove picker for production)
- [ ] **Player tag-based login URLs** for automatic access management

## TypeScript Build Issues & Fixes (Expert Coder Notes)

**Date**: 2025-09-25  
**Context**: Authentication system implementation required several TypeScript fixes before successful build/deployment

### Issues Encountered & Solutions:

#### 1. **Supabase Admin API Method Changes**
- **Issue**: `supabase.auth.admin.getUserByEmail()` method doesn't exist
- **Error**: `Property 'getUserByEmail' does not exist on type 'GoTrueAdminApi'`
- **Fix**: Use `supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()` and filter client-side:
  ```typescript
  // ‚ùå Old (broken)
  const userResponse = await supabase.auth.admin.getUserByEmail(payload.email);
  const user = userResponse?.data?.user;
  
  // ‚úÖ New (working)
  const userResponse = await supabase.auth.admin.listUsers();
  const user = userResponse?.data?.users?.find(u => u.email === payload.email);
  ```

#### 2. **Button Component Size Props**
- **Issue**: `size="xs"` not supported in Button component
- **Error**: `Type '"xs"' is not assignable to type 'ButtonSize | undefined'`
- **Fix**: Use supported sizes only (`'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'`):
  ```typescript
  // ‚ùå Old (broken)
  <Button size="xs" />
  
  // ‚úÖ New (working)
  <Button size="sm" />
  ```

#### 3. **Type Property Mismatches**
- **Issue**: Accessing non-existent properties on TypeScript interfaces
- **Error**: `Property 'description' does not exist on type 'ActivityEvidence'`
- **Fix**: Use correct property names from interface:
  ```typescript
  // ‚ùå Old (broken)
  {activity.description && <p>{activity.description}</p>}
  
  // ‚úÖ New (working)
  {activity.indicators && activity.indicators.length > 0 && 
    <p>{activity.indicators.join(', ')}</p>}
  ```

#### 4. **Store Type Inference Issues**
- **Issue**: TypeScript can't infer proper types in Zustand store initialization
- **Error**: `Type 'string' is not assignable to type '"table" | "cards"'`
- **Fix**: Use explicit type assertions:
  ```typescript
  // ‚ùå Old (broken)
  rosterViewMode: 'table',
  impersonatedRole: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_ANON_ACCESS === 'true' ? 'leader' : null,
  
  // ‚úÖ New (working)
  rosterViewMode: 'table' as const,
  impersonatedRole: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOW_ANON_ACCESS === 'true' ? 'leader' as ClanRoleName : null,
  ```

### Prevention Strategies:

1. **API Method Validation**: Always check current Supabase documentation for admin API methods
2. **Component Prop Types**: Verify all component props match their TypeScript interfaces
3. **Type Safety**: Use `as const` assertions for literal types in stores
4. **Interface Compliance**: Ensure all property accesses match actual interface definitions
5. **Build Testing**: Run `npm run build` locally before committing to catch TypeScript errors early

### Key Takeaway:
The authentication system implementation was solid, but several TypeScript strictness issues required fixes. Always test builds locally before deployment to catch these issues early.

## Clan Player Scoring Framework (Future Idea)
- Track ACE (clan contribution) alongside Hero Momentum (self progression).
- Hero Momentum: weekly snapshots + 4-week rolling window, compute ŒîBK/ŒîAQ/ŒîGW/ŒîRC, EMA trend, idle week streaks, upgrade streaks.
- Engagement Index = 100 - (idleWeeks*12) + (upgradeStreak*4) + (EMA*6) to penalize inactivity and reward streaks.
- ACE inputs: donations, war stars/consistency, CWL participation, general activity normalized per season; scale 0‚Äì2000.
- Optional Combined Clan Score = 0.65*ACE + 0.35*EI for all-rounder ranking.
- Dashboard hooks: ACE leaderboard, hero heatmap, momentum streaks, watchlist (EI drop/idle weeks), recovery highlights, all-rounders, Discord challenges (longest upgrade streak, most improved ACE, highest EI gain, weekly top builders/needs a nudge).
