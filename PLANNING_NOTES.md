## Smart Insights Consolidation (Work In Progress)

### Current ‚ÄúAI‚Äù Feature Inventory
- **Coaching advice** (`AICoaching` panel, `/api/ai-coaching/generate`, `ai-processor.generateCoachingAdvice`) ‚Äì personalized tips + ready-to-paste chat.
- **Change summaries** (`ChangeDashboard`, quick actions ‚ÄúGenerate Summary‚Äù, `/api/ai-summary/generate`, `ai-summarizer.generateChangeSummary`) ‚Äì narrative digest of roster deltas.
- **Snapshot headlines** (`QuickActions` snapshot copy, `ai-storage.generateSnapshotSummary`) ‚Äì text summary injected into clipboard/export flows.
- **Player DNA insights** (`PlayerDNADashboard`, `/api/ai/dna-cache`, `ai-processor.generatePlayerDNAInsights`) ‚Äì ‚Äúarchetype‚Äù cards for members.
- **Clan DNA overview** (`PlayerDNADashboard` overview, `ai-processor.generateClanDNAInsights`) ‚Äì health/weakness callouts.
- **Game chat blurbs** (`FullSnapshotDashboard`, `ai-processor.generateGameChatMessages`) ‚Äì optional templated shout-outs.
- **Nightly batch pipeline** (`cron/daily-snapshot`, `ai-processor.processBatchAI`, Supabase `batch_ai_results`) ‚Äì orchestrates all of the above and caches outputs.
- **Force-refresh flow** (`/api/admin/force-refresh`, Settings modal) ‚Äì on-demand snapshot & insights run.

### Pain Points
- Multiple prompts/pipelines create inconsistent tone and brittle parsing.
- UI labels scream ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, scattered across tabs so failures feel pervasive.
- Insights buried in separate panels instead of a single ‚ÄúWhat matters now‚Äù feed.
- Storage duplication (Supabase + localStorage + ad hoc copies) complicates refresh/fallback logic.

### Consolidation Direction
1. **Rename + Reframe**
   - Replace ‚ÄúAI Coaching‚Äù, ‚ÄúAI Summary‚Äù, etc. with ‚ÄúSmart Insights‚Äù, ‚ÄúCoaching‚Äù, ‚ÄúDaily Headlines‚Äù.
   - Audit copy for ‚ÄúAI‚Äù references and switch to value-focused language (‚ÄúAutomatic insights‚Äù, ‚ÄúDaily highlights‚Äù).

2. **Single Insights Service**
   - Promote `ai-processor` to `smart-insights-service` with one orchestrator that produces a typed payload:
     ```ts
     interface SmartInsightsPayload {
       headlines: Headline[];        // surfaced on dashboard
       coaching: Recommendation[];   // actionable items
       playerSpotlights: Spotlight[];// optional individual cards
       diagnostics: InsightMeta;     // timestamps, health flags
     }
     ```
   - Internally reuse shared prompt builders for snapshot context + roster stats.
   - Persist a single JSON blob per snapshot (Supabase + local cache) instead of per-feature arrays.

3. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Add ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Headlines‚Äù section to the main dashboard header/body fed by `payload.headlines`.
   - Feature limited actionable cards (top 3 coaching tips) with ‚ÄúView more insights‚Äù link.
   - Move detailed player DNA + clan archetype views under expandable ‚ÄúDeep Dive‚Äù modal fed from same payload.

4. **Resilient Fallbacks**
   - Centralize error handling in service; when generation fails, serve last known payload + ‚ÄúStale insight‚Äù badge.
   - Continue nightly cron, but allow manual refresh to only regenerate missing pieces.

### Immediate Tasks (Suggested Order)
1. **Terminology sweep** ‚Äì search/replace UI copy to drop ‚ÄúAI‚Äù branding; update navigation labels, button text, toasts.
2. **Define `SmartInsightsPayload`** ‚Äì schema + type in `lib/smart-insights.ts`; adapt batch runner to emit it while still backfilling current consumers.
3. **Build dashboard headlines section** ‚Äì surface top 3 highlights in `ClientDashboard` with fallback messaging when payload stale.
4. **Adapter layer** ‚Äì shim existing components (coaching panel, DNA dashboard) to read from unified payload before full refactor.
5. **Deprecate legacy endpoints** ‚Äì once adapters migrated, collapse `/api/ai-*` routes into `/api/insights/*`.

### Open Questions
- Do we keep player DNA calculations if no OpenAI key is present (pure heuristics vs. removal)?
- Should coaching/chat messages remain shareable to Discord, and if so, what‚Äôs the preferred format post-consolidation?
- How fresh do ‚ÄúHeadlines‚Äù need to be (live refresh vs. nightly snapshot)?

## Access Management
- [ ] **Role inheritance** from login (remove picker for production)
- [ ] **Player tag-based login URLs** for automatic access management
