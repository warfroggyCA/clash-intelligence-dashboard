## üé® Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

1. **TooltipManager Component**: Already in place (`/app/web-next/src/components/TooltipManager.tsx`)
   - Converts `title` attributes to `data-tooltip` attributes
   - Handles CSS styling via `globals.css`
   - Manages tooltip display on hover

2. **HTML `title` Attributes**: Added to all interactive elements
   - Automatically picked up by TooltipManager
   - Converted to styled tooltips on page load

3. **Cursor Styles**: Added `cursor-help` class to elements with tooltips
   - Provides visual cue that tooltip is available
   - Changes cursor to question mark on hover

### CSS Styling

Tooltips are styled in `/app/web-next/src/app/globals.css`:
- Dark background (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)`)
- White text
- Padding: 8px 12px
- Border radius: 6px
- Positioned above element with arrow
- Appears on hover with smooth transition
- Preserves line breaks with `white-space: pre-line`

## üì± Mobile & Desktop Parity

‚úÖ **Desktop Table View**: All tooltips fully implemented  
‚úÖ **Mobile Card View**: All tooltips fully implemented with same content

Both views provide identical tooltip information, ensuring consistent UX across all devices.

---

## üîÑ Dynamic Tooltip Content

All tooltips are **dynamically generated** based on actual player data:

1. **Activity Score**: Shows real score (0-65) and actual indicators earned
2. **Rush %**: Shows actual hero levels vs max for current TH
3. **League**: Shows actual league name and trophy count
4. **Donations**: Shows real donation balance and interpretation

**Example Code Pattern:**
```typescript
const activityTooltip = `Activity Score: ${activity.score}/65 pts
‚Ä¢ ${activity.indicators.join('\n‚Ä¢ ')}

Scoring:
‚Ä¢ Ranked battles (0-20 pts)
‚Ä¢ Donations (0-15 pts)
‚Ä¢ Hero development (0-10 pts)
‚Ä¢ Leadership role (0-10 pts)
‚Ä¢ Trophy level (0-10 pts)`;
```
