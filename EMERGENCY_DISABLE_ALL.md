# üö® EMERGENCY: Disable All Problematic Components

## Components to Disable (All subscribe to roster object):

1. ‚úÖ RosterSummary - ALREADY DISABLED
2. ‚ùå RosterTable - MAIN VIEW (can't disable)
3. ‚ùå TournamentCard
4. ‚ùå RosterStatsPanel
5. ‚ùå RosterHighlightsPanel

7. ‚ùå PlayerHeroProgress
8. ‚ùå PlayerProfilePage

## The Real Problem

The ENTIRE app architecture is built on direct store subscriptions to complex objects.
This creates infinite loops because Zustand treats every access as a new subscription.

## Solution Options

### Option A: Nuclear - Disable Everything Except Core
- Keep only: Dashboard shell, basic navigation, player list
- Disable: All analytics, all summaries, all complex views
- Time: 1 hour
- Risk: Very low (nothing to break)

### Option B: Fix Store Architecture
- Rewrite Zustand store to use shallow comparison
- Add proper selectors for ALL data
- Update ALL components to use selectors
- Time: 3-5 days
- Risk: High (might introduce new bugs)

### Option C: Start Fresh
- Build new dashboard with proper architecture
- Move features one by one
- Time: 1-2 weeks
- Risk: Medium (can keep old version as fallback)
