"description": "Ensure all new functions, pages, and features pull data exclusively from the canonical dataset, with historical data relying on Supabase pulls. Prevent creation of redundant or non-canonical data pathways.",
"alwaysApply": true,
"severity": "error",
"behavior": [
"Always use the canonical data source as the single source of truth for all non-historical data operations.",
"For historical data, rely on Supabase pulls as the defined method for accessing that data.",
"Do not create new or duplicate data fetch paths â€” always access canonical and historical data through the established canonical dataset or Supabase.",
"If needed data does not exist in the canonical dataset or Supabase, suggest extending the canonical model or Supabase schema to include it instead of creating a new data source.",
"Use existing data interfaces, query utilities, or APIs defined in the project to access canonical and historical data.",
"All code that reads, transforms, or displays data must trace its source back to the canonical model or Supabase pulls.",
"If a non-canonical data source is detected, flag this and recommend integrating it into the canonical dataset or Supabase."
],
"goal": "Maintain strict consistency and traceability by ensuring all data originates from the canonical dataset or Supabase for historical data. Promote maintainability, prevent data duplication, and improve reliability across all features."
