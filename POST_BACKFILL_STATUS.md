# Post-Backfill Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Items

### 1. Database Migration
- SQL migration `20250217_add_player_day_builder_war_columns.sql` has been applied ‚úÖ
- New columns added to `player_day` table:
  - `attack_wins` (integer)
  - `defense_wins` (integer)
  - `builder_hall_level` (integer)
  - `builder_battle_wins` (integer)
  - `builder_trophies` (integer)

### 2. Backfill Execution
- Ran `npm run backfill:player-day` successfully ‚úÖ
- Results: 14 players, 56 snapshots, 0 inserted, 29 updated, 27 skipped
- Historical data now includes new builder/war columns

### 3. Code Integration
- `generatePlayerDayRow` function updated to extract new fields ‚úÖ
- Deltas properly calculated for:
  - `attack_wins`
  - `defense_wins`
  - `builder_hall`
  - `builder_battle_wins`
  - `builder_trophies`
- `buildActivityEvent` function maps new fields to timeline events ‚úÖ
- Enhanced `timelineInsights` logic implemented with:
  - War activity tracking (stars, attack wins, defense wins, streaks)
  - Capital contribution tracking
  - Builder push detection (hall upgrades, wins, trophies)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Issue #1: Enhanced Timeline Insights Not Displaying
**Status**: Not working as expected
**Symptoms**: 
- "Recent Activity Highlights" only shows "Regularly active: 4 tracked days this week"
- War/capital/builder insights not appearing
- Activity breakdown table not showing

**Likely Cause**: 
The deltas in the timeline data appear sparse. Checking the API response shows:
```json
{
  "deltas": {
    "th": -1,
    "trophies": 3246
  }
}
```

The new builder/war deltas are not being populated in most timeline points.

**Root Cause Analysis Needed**:
1. Are the new columns being populated correctly during ingestion?
2. Is the backfill properly extracting builder/war data from canonical snapshots?
3. Are the delta calculations working correctly for these new fields?

### Issue #2: Sparse Delta Data
**Status**: Investigation needed
**Symptoms**:
- Most timeline points have empty or minimal deltas
- Only `trophies` and `th` deltas are consistently present
- Builder and war deltas are missing

**Next Steps**:
1. Check if canonical snapshots have the required source data
2. Verify the backfill is correctly mapping from canonical to player_day
3. Ensure deltas are calculated when previous day data exists

## üîç Debugging Steps Performed

1. ‚úÖ Verified backfill completed successfully (29 rows updated)
2. ‚úÖ Confirmed code implementation is present
3. ‚úÖ Checked API response structure
4. ‚úÖ Verified UI components are rendering correctly
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Found deltas are sparse/missing for new fields

## üìã Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate
1. **Investigate why deltas aren't being populated**
   - Check a sample player_day row to see if attack_wins, defense_wins, etc. have values
   - Verify the backfill is correctly extracting these from canonical snapshots
   - Ensure the delta calculation logic is triggered when previous data exists

2. **Verify canonical snapshot data**
   - Confirm that canonical snapshots contain war and builder data
   - Check if the data is in the expected structure
   - Verify the mapping logic in `toCanonicalPlayerState`

3. **Test with a manual ingestion**
   - Run a manual ingestion to see if new data gets the deltas
   - Check if tonight's cron will populate deltas correctly

### Short-term
1. **Add debug logging**
   - Add console logs to see what deltas are being calculated
   - Log the before/after values for builder/war fields
   - Track which timeline points have sparse deltas

2. **Spot-check specific players**
   - Find players with known war activity
   - Verify their attack_wins/defense_wins are changing
   - Confirm deltas are calculated correctly

### Long-term
1. **Monitor tonight's ingestion**
   - Check Vercel logs for successful run
   - Verify new player_day entries have populated deltas
   - Confirm enhanced insights appear for players with activity

2. **Update consumers if needed**
   - Ensure all code paths use the new delta fields
   - Update any dashboards that rely on activity data
   - Test the full pipeline end-to-end

## üìä Current State Summary

**Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Ready (DB schema, migrations, backfill script)
**Code**: ‚úÖ Implemented (delta calculation, timeline insights, UI components)
**Data**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially populated (deltas are sparse, needs investigation)
**Features**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not working yet (enhanced insights not displaying due to data issues)

## üöÄ When Everything Works

Once the delta population issue is resolved, users will see:

### Overview Tab - "Recent Activity Highlights"
- Donation streaks
- Trophy surges/drops
- **War gains** (stars, attack wins, defense wins, streaks)
- **Capital invested** (weekly gold contributions)
- **Builder push** (hall upgrades, wins, trophy gains)
- Active day counts

### History Tab - "Activity Streaks & Highlights"
- Same insights as overview
- Contextual weekly performance patterns

### Activity Breakdown Table
Two-column grid showing:
- War: score + supporting stats
- Capital: score + gold contributed
- Builder: score + wins/upgrades
- Donations: score + troops given/received

This provides leaders with a comprehensive view of player activity across all game modes.
