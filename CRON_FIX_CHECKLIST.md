# üö® VERCEL CRON FIX - ACTION REQUIRED

## What Was Wrong
**Vercel cron jobs have been SILENTLY FAILING every night since deployment!**

The endpoint was configured for POST requests, but Vercel cron jobs send GET requests. This means every scheduled run at 3 AM has been failing with a 405 Method Not Allowed error.

## What Was Fixed
‚úÖ Changed `/api/cron/daily-ingestion` from POST to GET handler  
‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation in `VERCEL_CRON_SETUP.md`  
‚úÖ Committed and pushed to GitHub  
‚úÖ Vercel is currently deploying (status: BUILDING)  

## üî¥ CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED

### You MUST verify this environment variable is set in Vercel:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select Project**: `clash-intelligence-dashboard-new`
3. **Go to**: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. **Verify this exists**:
   - **Name**: `CRON_SECRET`
   - **Value**: `my-clash-cron-secret-2025`
   - **Environment**: ‚úÖ Production (must be checked!)

### If it's NOT there or incorrect:
1. Add/update the variable
2. Redeploy: Go to Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí Click "Redeploy"

## How to Verify It's Working

### Option 1: Wait for Next Scheduled Run
- **Next run**: Tomorrow at 3:00 AM UTC
- **Check logs** in Vercel:
  - Go to Deployments ‚Üí Production ‚Üí Functions
  - Look for `/api/cron/daily-ingestion` execution
  - Should see: `[Cron] Starting daily ingestion job at...`

### Option 2: Test Manually Right Now
```bash
curl -X GET "https://clash-intelligence-dashboard-new-dougs-projects-e9ca299b.vercel.app/api/cron/daily-ingestion" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer my-clash-cron-secret-2025"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T..."
}
```

**If you get 401 Unauthorized**: The CRON_SECRET is not set or incorrect in Vercel  
**If you get 500 Error**: Check function logs for details  

## Timeline

- ‚úÖ **Now**: Fix deployed and building
- ‚è≥ **5-10 min**: Build completes
- üîÑ **Next**: Verify CRON_SECRET in Vercel
- üîÑ **Then**: Test manually OR wait for 3 AM UTC
- ‚úÖ **Success**: Daily snapshots will start working again!

## Why This Matters

Without working cron jobs:
- ‚ùå No daily roster snapshots
- ‚ùå No automatic change detection
- ‚ùå No member tracking updates
- ‚ùå Stale player data in profiles
- ‚ùå Dashboard shows outdated information

**This is why player profiles were broken and showing stale data!**

## Files Changed

1. `web-next/src/app/api/cron/daily-ingestion/route.ts` - Fixed POST ‚Üí GET
2. `web-next/VERCEL_CRON_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
3. This checklist - Action items for you

## Next Steps

1. üî¥ **PRIORITY 1**: Verify `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel (see above)
2. ‚ö™ Test the endpoint manually (optional but recommended)
3. ‚ö™ Check Vercel function logs tomorrow morning to confirm it ran
4. ‚ö™ Verify dashboard shows fresh data after successful run
