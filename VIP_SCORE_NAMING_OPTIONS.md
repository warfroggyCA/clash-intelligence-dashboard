# Metric Name Options: Comprehensive Clan Contributor Score

## Context
This metric measures both **dedication (effort)** and **success (skill/outcome)** across all game modes:
- Competitive Performance (ranked mode, war)
- Clan Support (donations, capital)
- Progression & Development (base quality, activity)

Essentially identifies **"VIP" players** - the most valuable contributors to the clan.

## Name Options

### Option 1: VIP Score ⭐ (Your Suggestion)
**VIP = Very Important Player**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clear, immediately understood
- ✅ Short and memorable
- ✅ Matches your "VIP measure" concept
- ✅ Distinct from ACE (which is more war-focused)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Could be confused with "VIP" status in other games

---

### Option 2: MVP Score
**MVP = Most Valuable Player**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Widely understood term
- ✅ Emphasizes "value" to clan
- ✅ Clear that it's about top performers

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ "MVP" might imply single best player (competitive connotation)
- ⚠️ Less inclusive than "VIP" (suggests one winner)

---

### Option 3: Elite Score
**Elite = Top Tier Contributor**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Suggests excellence without exclusivity
- ✅ Professional sounding
- ✅ Clear hierarchy implication

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Might feel too exclusive/competitive

---

### Option 4: Champion Score
**Champion = Exemplary Clan Member**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Strong, positive connotation
- ✅ Suggests leadership qualities
- ✅ Memorable

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Might imply competitive focus only

---

### Option 5: Enhanced ACE Score
**ACE = All-Mode Clan Excellence** (already exists)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Maintains existing brand
- ✅ "Enhanced" clarifies it's improved version
- ✅ Already documented in codebase

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ ACE is currently war-focused; this would be broader
- ⚠️ Might confuse users about what changed

---

### Option 6: CCI Score
**CCI = Comprehensive Clan Impact**

**Pros:**
- ✅ Descriptive of what it measures
- ✅ Professional/academic sounding
- ✅ Clear acronym

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Less memorable than VIP/MVP
- ⚠️ Doesn't convey "top player" concept as clearly

---

## Recommendation

**VIP Score** is the best choice because:
1. ✅ Matches your "VIP measure" concept exactly
2. ✅ Clear and memorable
3. ✅ Distinct from ACE (which is war-focused)
4. ✅ Conveys "Very Important Player" - someone who contributes across all areas
5. ✅ Works well in UI: "VIP Score: 85.3"

**Alternative:** If you want to be more specific, **"VIP Contributor Score"** clarifies it's about contribution, not just status.

---

## Implementation Note

This would be separate from:
- **ACE Score** (war-focused, already exists)
- **WCI Score** (weekly competitive, ranked mode focus)

VIP Score would be the **comprehensive, all-mode metric** that combines:
- Competitive performance (WCI components + war)
- Clan support (donations, capital)
- Progression (development, activity)
