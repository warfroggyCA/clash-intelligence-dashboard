## üöÄ Quick Start - 5 Minute Test

### Test 1: Automated Lighthouse Audit (2 minutes)

**In Chrome/Edge:**
1. Open your site: https://heckyeah.clashintelligence.com
2. Right-click anywhere ‚Üí **Inspect** (or press F12)
3. Click **Lighthouse** tab (top navigation)
4. Check only ‚úÖ **Accessibility**
5. Select **Desktop** or **Mobile**
6. Click **Analyze page load**

**What to Look For:**
- Current score (likely 60-80)
- Red/Orange issues in the report
- Compare with audit report issues

**Expected Results:**
```
Current Score: ~70
After Critical Fixes: ~85
After All Fixes: 95+
```

### Test 2: Color Contrast Check (1 minute)

**Using Browser Extension:**
1. Install [axe DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd) (Chrome/Edge)
2. Open your site
3. Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Click **axe DevTools** tab
4. Click **Scan ALL of my page**

**Look for these specific issues:**
- "Elements must have sufficient color contrast" ‚ùå
- Text showing contrast ratios < 4.5:1
- Specifically look for `text-slate-400` and `text-muted` classes

**Screenshot the results** to compare with my findings!

---

### Test 3: Keyboard Navigation (2 minutes)

**Manual Test:**
1. Open your site in a **new incognito window** (ensures clean state)
2. Close your mouse pointer (don't use it!)
3. Press **Tab** repeatedly
4. Check:
   - ‚ùå Can you see where focus is? (Should have visible blue outline)
   - ‚ùå Can you reach ALL interactive elements?
   - ‚ùå Does Tab order make sense (top‚Üíbottom, left‚Üíright)?
   - ‚ùå Are any elements skipped?

**Critical Test Points:**
- Tab through navigation buttons (Dashboard, History, Command Center, etc.)
- Tab to "Show Filters" button - press **Enter** - can you reach all filter controls?
- Tab through the roster table - can you reach sort buttons?
- Press **Enter** on player name - does it navigate?

**Expected Issues You'll Find:**
- Focus may be hard to see on some buttons
- Some icon-only buttons may not be reachable
- Tab order might skip important elements

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Testing Tools & Methods

### Tool 1: WAVE Browser Extension (Best for Visual Testing)

**Installation:**
1. Install [WAVE Extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
2. Visit your site
3. Click WAVE icon in toolbar

**What You'll See:**

**Expected Findings:**
- Red error for missing form labels
- Red errors for low contrast text

**Take Screenshots:**
```
Dashboard page: X errors, Y alerts
Command Center: X errors, Y alerts
Player DB: X errors, Y alerts
```

### Tool 2: Color Contrast Analyzer (Precise Testing)

**Online Tool:**
1. Visit [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
2. Test these specific combinations from your site:

**Dark Theme Tests:**
| Foreground | Background | Current Ratio | Pass? |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| #94A3B8 (text-slate-400) | #0B1220 (dark bg) | ~2.8:1 | ‚ùå FAIL |
| #64748B (text-slate-500) | #0B1220 (dark bg) | ~2.1:1 | ‚ùå FAIL |

| #FFFFFF (text-primary) | #0B1220 (dark bg) | ~18:1 | ‚úÖ PASS |

**How to Find Colors:**
1. Right-click element ‚Üí Inspect
2. In Styles panel, find `color` property
3. Note the hex/rgba value
4. Find background color of parent element
5. Enter both in WebAIM tool

**Light Theme Tests:**

## üêõ Common Testing Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Don't Do This:
- Testing only in Chrome (test Safari, Firefox, Edge too)
- Using only automated tools (manual testing is critical)
- Testing with mouse only (must test keyboard)
- Skipping screen reader testing
- Testing on laptop only (must test mobile)
- Testing at 100% zoom only (test 200%, 400%)
- Assuming fixes work without re-testing

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead:
- Test in multiple browsers
- Combine automated + manual testing
- Test keyboard, screen reader, touch
- Test on real mobile devices
- Test at different zoom levels
- Re-test after every fix
- Get feedback from users with disabilities

---
