## 🎨 FOR UI/UX AUDIT AGENT: START HERE

If you're tasked with performing a UI/UX audit, here's what you need to know:

### **Current Situation:**
- New Command Center exists in code but may not be on production yet
- User wants accessibility, contrast, and UX improvements across the ENTIRE site
- Focus on the live production site: https://heckyeah.clashintelligence.com

### **Your Mission:**
1. ✅ Review production site for UI/UX issues
2. ✅ Check accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
3. ✅ Test color contrast ratios
4. ✅ Verify mobile responsiveness
5. ✅ Check keyboard navigation
6. ✅ Assess visual consistency
7. ✅ Create prioritized list of issues (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
8. ✅ Implement fixes for CRITICAL and HIGH priority items

### **What You CANNOT Do:**
- ❌ Access the cloud preview environment (it was session-specific)
- ❌ Run the dev server yourself (you don't have that environment)
- ❌ Test changes in real-time (you'll need to make changes and user tests)

### **What You CAN Do:**
- ✅ View the production site in screenshots
- ✅ Analyze the code in `/app/web-next/src/`
- ✅ Read all component files
- ✅ Identify issues by reviewing HTML/CSS
- ✅ Make code changes to fix issues
- ✅ Document recommended changes

### **Recommended Workflow:**
1. Take screenshots of key pages (Dashboard, Command Center, Roster, Player Profile)
2. Analyze for contrast issues (use tools in your analysis)
3. Review code for accessibility problems (missing ARIA labels, etc.)
4. Create prioritized issue list with file locations
5. Ask user: "Should I implement these fixes now or wait?"
6. If yes: Make changes to component files
7. User pushes to GitHub and verifies

### **Key Pages to Audit:**
- **Dashboard** (`/app/web-next/src/app/page.tsx`, `ClientDashboard.tsx`)
- **Command Center** (`/app/web-next/src/components/CommandCenter.tsx`)
- **Roster Table** (`/app/web-next/src/components/roster/RosterTable.tsx`)
- **Player Profile** (`/app/web-next/src/app/player/[tag]/page.tsx`)
- **Global Styles** (`/app/web-next/src/app/globals.css`)

### **Known Issues to Check:**
- Some text may have low contrast in dark mode
- Mobile responsiveness needs work
- Touch targets may be too small
- Loading states might be inconsistent
- Error states might not be accessible

### **Don't Waste Time On:**
- ❌ Trying to access cloud preview (you can't)
- ❌ Asking user to run local dev server just for audit
- ❌ Rebuilding features that are already done
- ❌ Questioning whether Command Center exists (it does, in code)
