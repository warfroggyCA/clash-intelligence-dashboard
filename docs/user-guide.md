## Welcome

Clash Intelligence turns daily Clash of Clans roster snapshots into a clear, leadership-ready dashboard. This guide walks you through the core experience‚Äîsigning in, reading the data, and acting on the insights‚Äîwithout digging into implementation details. Keep it open while you explore; we‚Äôll update it alongside new releases.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Sign in** ‚Äì Visit `/login`, enter your email, then either provide your password or request a magic link. Once confirmed you‚Äôll land on the dashboard home.
2. **Check the clan banner** ‚Äì The header shows which clan is loaded. Leaders see their current role badge.
3. **Review the snapshot** ‚Äì The Dashboard tab opens by default with current roster metrics and season progress. Look for the freshness badge to confirm how recent the data is.
4. **Explore other tabs** ‚Äì Use the emoji tabs across the top to jump to Insights, History, or leadership tools. Tabs you don‚Äôt have permission to use stay hidden.
5. **Stay informed** ‚Äì Toasts in the bottom corner call out successes or issues (for example, if a refresh fails).

Tip: Leaders can switch clans or reload the ‚Äúhome‚Äù clan from the command rail on the right-hand side.

## Dashboard Basics

- **Header strip** ‚Äì Shows clan name, your role (or impersonated role), data freshness, and quick toggles (theme, font size, leadership preview).
- **Tab navigation** ‚Äì Emoji-labelled buttons across the top. Only tabs you‚Äôre allowed to view appear. The active tab is highlighted.
- **Main canvas** ‚Äì Fills the center of the page with cards, tables, and charts relevant to the selected tab.
- **Command rail** *(leaders and trusted roles)* ‚Äì A collapsible right-side panel summarizing snapshot health, offering refresh buttons, and linking to leadership utilities.
- **Quick actions tray** ‚Äì Handy buttons for copying reports, exporting data, and refreshing insights. Appears on tabs that support those actions.
- **Toasts & modals** ‚Äì Success or error messages pop up near the bottom. Leadership actions often open modals for finer control (e.g., access manager, departures, player profile).

## Working with the Tabs

### Dashboard (üõ°Ô∏è)
- Snapshot summary cards show member count, season progress, recent wars, and average hero levels.
- The roster table supports sorting, filtering, and responsive cards on mobile. Use the search box or filter bar to focus on specific roles, Town Hall levels, or donation behavior.
- Clicking a member opens their profile modal for detailed stats, hero levels, and notes (permissions permitting).

### Insights (üí°)
- ‚ÄúSnapshot & Data Health‚Äù flags the loaded clan, member count, snapshot age, and insight status.
- ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Briefing‚Äù surfaces automated callouts about hero progress, donation swings, or leadership opportunities.
- ‚ÄúLatest Change Summary‚Äù highlights the most recent roster shifts with a quick jump to the History tab.
- ‚ÄúLeadership Callouts‚Äù (leaders only) ranks action items with priority badges and suggested share text.

### History (üìú)
- Designed to chart departures, promotions, and other roster changes over time.
- UI polish is in progress. For now, use the quick links in Insights to review change summaries.

### Player DB (üóÑÔ∏è), Applicants (üéØ), Discord (üì¢), Events (üìä)
- These tabs are gradually rolling out. You may see a ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù screen or a placeholder hero section.
- Once active, they‚Äôll focus on long-term player records, applicant scoring, Discord-ready announcements, and milestone tracking respectively.

## Leadership Toolkit

Leaders, co-leaders, and trusted analysts unlock extra controls:

- **Command rail shortcuts** ‚Äì Refresh the current snapshot, trigger a fresh ingestion job, or jump into the ingestion monitor.
- **Home clan management** ‚Äì Save or switch the home clan so the dashboard auto-loads the correct roster on sign-in.
- **Access manager** ‚Äì Invite new staff members, adjust roles, and revoke access.
- **Departure manager** ‚Äì Review who left the clan recently and acknowledge notifications.
- **Player profiles** ‚Äì Update notes, set activity overrides, and prep for coaching conversations.

Keep an eye on the role badge in the header. If you need to preview the dashboard as a lower role, use the impersonation dropdown (when available) to double-check what they can see.

---

## Staying Up to Date

- **Refresh snapshot** ‚Äì Pull in the latest stored data with the ‚ÄúRefresh Snapshot‚Äù button in the command rail or quick actions.
- **Run ingestion** ‚Äì Leaders can start a new data pull when major changes happen mid-day. Expect a short delay while the job finishes.
- **Check freshness** ‚Äì The dashboard labels data as Fresh (‚â§24h), Stale (24‚Äì48h), or Outdated (>48h). Refresh if it‚Äôs stale before making decisions.
- **Track insights** ‚Äì If headlines feel out of date, click ‚ÄúRefresh Insights‚Äù to regenerate coaching notes and change summaries.
- **Watch toasts** ‚Äì Any failures (for example, network hiccups) show up here. Retrigger the action or contact support if it persists.

## Help & Troubleshooting

| Situation | What you see | Try this |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No roster after sign-in | Command rail says ‚ÄúNo clan loaded‚Äù | Set or reload your home clan, then hit **Refresh Snapshot**. |
| Insights look old | Headlines mention stale data or the status badge says ‚ÄúStale‚Äù | Click **Refresh Insights**. If it fails again, wait a moment and retry. |
| Ingestion errors | Command rail reports a failed job | Open **Monitor Jobs** for more detail, then rerun ingestion once the cause is clear. |
| Copy/export blocked | Browser warning about clipboard permissions | Allow clipboard access or choose the download option instead of copy. |
| Login loop | Sign-in succeeds but returns to the login page | Confirm your email via the Supabase link or contact an admin to check your role assignment. |

Need more help? Capture a screenshot of the toast or error message and share it with the operations team.

- Ship the Player Database, Applicants, Discord Publisher, and Events dashboards.
- Add a first-run walkthrough for new leaders and tighten accessibility (keyboard hints, contrast checks).
- Expand automated insights with war readiness and donation balance spotlights.

Feedback is welcome‚Äîleave notes in `PLANNING_NOTES.md` or message the team.

## Appendix A ‚Äì Technical Background (Optional)

- **Snapshots & seasons** ‚Äì Ingestion captures nightly roster data and tags it with a season that runs from the 1st of each month at 05:00 UTC to the next month‚Äôs 1st at 04:59:59 UTC. Season data powers the progress bar and reporting rollups.
- **Data sources** ‚Äì Local development can rely on bundled JSON files; staging and production load data from Supabase projects. Production builds default to Supabase for safety.
- **Authentication & roles** ‚Äì Supabase manages sign-ins. Roles (`leader`, `coleader`, `elder`, `member`, `viewer`) determine which tabs appear via leadership guards. Anonymous preview mode can impersonate a leader for demos.
- **Behind-the-scenes tools** ‚Äì The ingestion monitor references job phases stored in Supabase; command rail metrics refresh every time you load or update a snapshot.

## Appendix B ‚Äì Advanced Actions & Exports

- **Copy roster JSON** ‚Äì Copies a structured snapshot (clan info, member stats, hero levels) for quick sharing.
- **Copy snapshot summary** ‚Äì Generates a Markdown digest including war results and capital raids for Discord or email posts.
- **Download JSON/CSV** ‚Äì Export the latest snapshot or war log to a file for deeper analysis.
- **Generate insights summary** ‚Äì Forces a fresh automated write-up when prepping leadership briefings.
- **CLI fallback** ‚Äì If web triggers fail, run `npm run ingest:run #CLANTAG` from the project root to pull data manually (leaders only).

Keep these appendices handy if you need to explain the system to technical teammates or perform advanced maintenance.
