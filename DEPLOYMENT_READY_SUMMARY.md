# Deployment Ready Summary - October 14, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Weekly Tournament Tracking
- **Last Week Column** added to roster table
- Shows final trophy count from Monday 4:30 AM UTC snapshot (before Tuesday reset)
- Captures competitive performance before weekly reset
- Full documentation in `WEEKLY_TOURNAMENT_TRACKING.md`

### 2. Cron Timing Optimization
- Cron schedule updated from 3:00 AM to **4:30 AM UTC**
- Captures data 30 minutes before weekly reset (Tuesday 5:00 AM UTC)
- Ensures Monday snapshots represent true "weekly finals"
- Updated in `vercel.json` and `VERCEL_CRON_SETUP.md`

### 3. Infallible Sorting Logic
- Three-tiered sorting: Competitive Flag ‚Üí League Tier ‚Üí Last Week Trophies
- Players with same league now sorted by performance (Last Week trophies)
- No hardcoded player lists - relies on API data structure
- Full documentation in `INFALLIBLE_SORTING_LOGIC.md`

### 4. Trophy Display
- Removed "k" abbreviation (e.g., "2,729" instead of "2.7k")
- Full numbers with comma formatting for clarity
- Consistent across all trophy columns

### 5. Data Integrity
- Added `snapshot_date` column to `member_snapshot_stats` for historical tracking
- Backfilled Monday snapshot data for Oct 13, 2025
- Manual corrections applied where needed (Mate–∏238: 1,839 ‚Üí 0)

### 6. League Badge Logic
- Correctly maps `leagueTier.id` from CoC API to `rankedLeagueId` in database
- Shows "Inactive" badge for unranked players (ID: 105000000)
- Shows correct league badges for competitive players

## üìã Next Iteration (Not Deployed)

### 1. Season Total Column
- **Status**: Documented, not implemented
- **Plan**: `RUNNING_TOTAL_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- **Purpose**: Show cumulative trophy total since Oct 1, 2025
- **Position**: Between "Last Week" and "Rush %"

### 2. Weekly Performance History
- **Status**: Planned
- **Purpose**: Chart showing weekly trophy progression over time
- **Related**: `season-total-api` and `weekly-history-view` TODOs

## üóÇÔ∏è Files Modified

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: Add Last Week trophy tracking and optimize cron timing
   
   - Add Last Week column to roster table showing Monday finals
   - Optimize cron to 4:30 AM UTC for weekly tournament capture
   - Fix sorting tiebreaker within same league
   - Add snapshot_date to member_snapshot_stats
   - Remove trophy 'k' abbreviation for clarity
   - Document weekly tournament tracking strategy"
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Vercel will auto-deploy from main branch
   - Verify cron job schedule in Vercel dashboard
   - Check deployment logs for any errors

4. **Post-Deployment Verification:**
   - Visit production URL
   - Check roster table displays correctly
   - Verify Last Week column shows data
   - Test sorting by clicking League header
   - Confirm cron job is scheduled (Vercel dashboard)

## üìä Current Data State

### Last Week Trophies (Oct 7-13, 2025)
- War.Frog: 431
- warfroggy: 380
- Headhuntress: 371
- CosmicThomas: 319
- Tigress: 274
- DoubleD: 239
- MD.Soudho$$: 134

- All others: 0 (no participation)

### Current Week (Oct 14-20, 2025)
- All players: 0 (new week started Tuesday Oct 14 at 5:00 AM UTC)
- Next cron run: Tuesday Oct 15 at 4:30 AM UTC

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Recommended Follow-Up

After deployment and 1-2 successful cron runs:
1. Implement **Season Total** column (cumulative tracking)
2. Build **Weekly History** view (chart/graph)
3. Consider adding **Weekly Competitive Index (WCI)** to replace ACE

## üéØ Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Roster table loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Last Week data displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Sorting works with performance tiebreaker
- ‚úÖ Cron job runs at 4:30 AM UTC daily
- ‚úÖ Monday snapshots capture weekly finals
- ‚úÖ Trophy display is clear and readable
