To run the backfill, you need to:

1. Set up Supabase credentials:
   export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
   export SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF="your-project-ref"

2. Or run the original script with environment variables:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-url" \\
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-key" \\
   npm run backfill:player-day

3. The backfill will:
   - Fetch all canonical_member_snapshots
   - Process them chronologically per player
   - Generate player_day rows with deltas and events
   - Upsert to player_day table
   - Skip duplicates based on snapshot_hash

4. Expected output:
   - Progress updates every 10 players
   - Total rows inserted
   - Completion summary
