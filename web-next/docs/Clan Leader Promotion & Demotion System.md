# **Algorithmic Governance in Clash of Clans: A Data-Driven Framework for Leadership Succession and Performance Management**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

The administration of a competitive *Clash of Clans* (CoC) clan has evolved from a casual social engagement into a complex management challenge resembling the operation of a small to medium-sized enterprise. As the game environment expands to include Clan War Leagues (CWL), Clan Capital raids, and monthly Clan Games, the data footprint generated by a single member has grown exponentially.1 Traditional leadership decisions—promotions, demotions, and succession planning—often suffer from recency bias, social favoritism, or a lack of holistic historical data. Leaders frequently promote the most vocal members rather than the most competent, or fail to demote deteriorating players until they have caused significant damage to the clan's war log.

This research report proposes a comprehensive, programmatically driven framework for identifying emerging leaders and candidates for demotion. By leveraging the official Supercell API, specifically through granular "nightly pulls" and longitudinal trend analysis, we can construct a **Composite Leadership Value (CLV)** model. This model moves beyond basic in-game statistics (like raw donation counts) to evaluate "second-order" traits such as behavioral consistency, network centrality, economic selflessness, and strategic efficiency.

The proposed system, the **Clan Leadership Succession Algorithm (CLSA)**, integrates distinct analytical modules: the **War Performance Index (WPI)** utilizing Bayesian skill rating systems, the **Social Capital & Economic Score (SCES)** applying graph theory to donation flows, and the **Behavioral Reliability Metric (BRM)** for churn prediction. Together, these form a roadmap that not only identifies who is performing well today but predicts who possesses the structural traits required for long-term governance.

**2\. The Data Ecosystem: API Architecture and Metric Acquisition**

To build a robust leadership roadmap, one must first understand the raw materials available within the Supercell API ecosystem. While the game interface provides a snapshot of current status, the API allows for the longitudinal tracking necessary to determine behavioral trends. The limitations of the API—specifically the lack of historical granularity for past wars and the absence of "last online" timestamps—necessitate a sophisticated data warehousing strategy.

### **2.1 Core API Endpoints and Their Analytical Value**

The Supercell API exposes several critical endpoints that serve as the foundation for the CLSA. A sophisticated nightly ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is required to warehouse this data for historical analysis, as the API is designed primarily for real-time status checks rather than historical reporting.3

#### **2.1.1 The /currentwar Endpoint: The Tactical Pulse**

The /clans/{clanTag}/currentwar endpoint is the single most critical source of tactical data. Unlike the /warlog, which provides only high-level summary data of past wars (win/loss, total stars), /currentwar provides specific attack details: who attacked whom, the destruction percentage, the star count, and the map position of both attacker and defender.5

However, this data is ephemeral. It is only available while the war is active and for a short period after. Once the war data is purged from the server, the granular attack-by-attack performance metrics are lost forever. Therefore, the programmatic solution requires a "Sentinel" script—a scheduled task running at least once every 48 hours (ideally every 12 hours) to capture the final state of every war before it vanishes.5 This captured data forms the basis of the War Performance Index.

#### **2.1.2 The /members Endpoint: The Economic Ledger**

The /clans/{clanTag}/members endpoint provides a roster snapshot, including roles, experience levels, trophy counts, and donation statistics (troops donated and troops received).4 While simple on the surface, longitudinal analysis of this endpoint allows for the calculation of *Donation Velocity* (the rate of donations per day) and *Donation Consistency* (the variance in donation behavior over time).

Crucially, this endpoint also provides league information and achievements progress if queried via the deep player endpoint. This allows the system to track activity levels even when a player is not chatting or warring, filling the gap left by the absence of a "Last Online" status.6

#### **2.1.3 The /players/{playerTag} Endpoint: The Deep Dive**

For individual assessment, the player endpoint offers detailed data on troop levels, hero levels, spell levels, and achievement progress. This data is essential for calculating **Strategic Rushing** scores. By comparing a player's Town Hall level to the sum of their hero levels and the weight of their defenses (inferred from war map position), the algorithm can determine if a player is "engineered" for war (high offense, optimized defense) or "rushed" in a detrimental way (high defense weight, low offense).8

### **2.2 The Challenge of "Invisible" Metrics and Inferential Logic**

The API has significant limitations that the CLSA must overcome through inferential logic. It does not explicitly provide a "Last Online" timestamp for security and privacy reasons.6 Nor does it provide a direct "War Weight" value, which is crucial for determining if a player is "punching up" (attacking a stronger base) or "punching down" (attacking a weaker base) in war.

To overcome these limitations, the CLSA utilizes **Inferential Metrics**:

| Inferential Metric | Methodology | Leadership Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Activity Epochs** | Tracking the delta of specific achievements (e.g., *Gold Grab*, *Elixir Escapade*, *Conqueror*) between nightly pulls. If Gold Grab increases, the player was online and farming. | **Reliability:** A leader must be present. A candidate with daily Activity Epochs is preferable to one with sporadic bursts. |
| **Defensive Weight Proxy** | The mapPosition in the /currentwar endpoint serves as a definitive ranking of defensive strength within the clan. Player \#1 is the heaviest; Player \#50 is the lightest. | **Strategic Insight:** By mapping mapPosition against Town Hall level, we distinguish "Strategic Rushers" from "Liability Rushers".10 |
| **Donation Latency** | Correlating donationsReceived timestamps with donationsGiven timestamps across the clan (requires frequent polling). | **Altruism:** Fast response times to requests indicate a player who is attentive to chat, a key trait for Co-Leaders.12 |

**3\. Module 1: The War Performance Index (WPI)**

In the context of clan leadership, war performance is not merely about accumulating stars; it is about **reliability** and **efficiency**. A leader who consistently scores 2 stars on the toughest bases is more valuable than a member who occasionally gets 3 stars but frequently misses attacks or fails completely. The WPI moves beyond simple averages to implement a robust statistical model derived from competitive gaming algorithms.

### **3.1 Beyond Average Stars: The "Wins Above Replacement" (WAR) Approach**

Standard war stars are a flawed metric. A Town Hall 16 (TH16) dipping to attack a Town Hall 14 (TH14) and securing 3 stars is contributing less "value" than a TH16 achieving a high-percentage 2-star (85%) against a fully maxed TH16 opponent. To capture this nuance, we adapt the **Wins Above Replacement (WAR)** philosophy from sabermetrics 13 and apply it to the CoC environment.

The WPI assesses the **Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)**. We establish a baseline "replacement level" performance for each Town Hall level (e.g., the average stars a generic TH13 scores against a generic TH13). A leadership candidate's WPI is the delta between their performance and this baseline.

#### **3.1.1 The "True Star" Calculation**

For every war attack, we calculate a **Performance Coefficient ($P\_c$)** that normalizes the outcome based on the difficulty of the target.

$$P\_c \= \\left( \\frac{Stars \\times 33.3 \+ Destruction\\%}{100} \\right) \\times \\text{Difficulty Modifier}$$  
The **Difficulty Modifier ($D\_m$)** is derived from the differential in map position (war weight) between the attacker and the defender 15:

* **Mirror Attack (Same Map Rank):** $1.0$ (Baseline)  
* **Dip (Attacking Lower Rank):** $1.0 \- (0.05 \\times \\text{Rank Difference})$. This penalizes "stat padding" by attacking weaker bases.  
* **Reach (Attacking Higher Rank):** $1.0 \+ (0.10 \\times \\text{Rank Difference})$. This rewards the courage to take on harder targets.

This formula ensures that a Co-Leader candidate who consistently cleans up lower bases to inflate their star count receives a lower WPI than a candidate who struggles but consistently attempts to crack the enemy's top bases.

### **3.2 Consistency and The Glicko-2 Implementation**

While averages tell part of the story, **variance** tells the rest. A leader must be a pillar of stability. A player who scores 3 stars in one war and 0 in the next (high variance) is a risk. A player who consistently scores high 2-stars (low variance) allows for better strategic planning.

To programmatically assess this, we recommend implementing a simplified **Glicko-2 rating system** 17 for internal clan rankings. Unlike Elo, Glicko-2 tracks a **Ratings Deviation (RD)**—a measure of uncertainty.

* **Rating ($R$):** The player's skill level.  
* **Deviation ($RD$):** The reliability of that rating.

A player who attacks infrequently or has highly volatile results will have a high $RD$. For leadership promotion, we filter for candidates with **High $R$ and Low $RD$**. This combination signifies a player who is both skilled and reliably so.

### **3.3 The "Clutch" Factor: Time-Weighted Performance**

Leadership often requires performing under pressure. Using the order field in the /currentwar attack list, we can determine *when* an attack occurred.

* **Early Attacks:** Set the tone.  
* **Late Attacks:** Decide the war.

We introduce a **Clutch Multiplier** for attacks occurring in the final 2 hours of a war where the star differential is $\< 5$. A candidate who consistently performs well in these high-pressure windows demonstrates the psychological resilience required for leadership. Conversely, a player who consistently waits until the last minute and fails is a liability.5

### **3.4 The Missed Attack Penalty**

There is no greater sin in clan leadership than missing a war attack. It signals a lack of organization and disrespect for the collective effort. The WPI includes a **Binary Reliability Flag**.

$$Penalty \= \\sum (\\text{Missed Attacks} \\times 50)$$  
This penalty is subtracted directly from the raw WPI score. A single missed attack can be forgiven (everyone has emergencies), but a pattern (e.g., \> 1 miss in 20 wars) essentially disqualifies a candidate from promotion to Co-Leader.20

## ---

**4\. Module 2: Social Capital & Economic Score (SCES)**

Leadership in *Clash of Clans* is fundamentally a service role. It involves thankless tasks: filling war clan castles (CCs), donating expensive troops for farming requests, and contributing resources to the Clan Capital. The SCES quantifies this "servant leadership" by analyzing economic flows within the clan.

### **4.1 Social Network Analysis (SNA): Mapping the Donation Graph**

Most clans simply look at the "Donations Sent" number. This is insufficient. A player could have 10,000 donations simply by dumping unwanted troops into open requests. To find a true leader, we must understand the **Donation Graph**.

Using the API to track donation changes over time (polling the member list every 10 minutes), we can infer a directed graph where nodes are players and edges are donation transactions.22

* **Hubs:** Players with a high *Out-Degree* (donate to many unique people). These are the philanthropists of the clan.  
* **Authorities:** Players with a high *In-Degree* (receive from many unique people). These are often the active "requesters" who drive clan activity.

For leadership promotion, we look for **Centrality**. We calculate the **PageRank** or **Eigenvector Centrality** of the donation graph. A candidate with high centrality is not just donating a lot; they are donating to the *core* of the clan, ensuring the most active members are supplied. This metric identifies the "logistical backbone" of the clan.24

### **4.2 Economic Velocity: Sustain vs. Spike**

Donation counts in the game profile accumulate over a season. However, leadership requires daily consistency. We differentiate between **Sustain Donors** and **Spike Donors**.25

* **Sustain Donor:** Donates 100-200 troops every single day. Their standard deviation of daily donations is low.  
* **Spike Donor:** Donates 2,000 troops on the last day of the season to "fix their ratio." Their standard deviation is massive.

The SCES favors the Sustain Donor. Programmatically, this is determined by calculating the **Coefficient of Variation ($CV$)** of daily donation deltas:

$$CV \= \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}$$  
Where $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of daily donations and $\\mu$ is the mean. A lower $CV$ indicates consistent, daily contribution—a hallmark of reliable leadership.

### **4.3 Capital Gold Contribution: The "Selflessness" Tax**

The Clan Capital represents a collective investment. Unlike home village upgrades, Capital contributions provide no direct individual defensive benefit; they only help the clan. Thus, Capital Gold contribution is the purest metric of **Selflessness**.26

The API exposes clanCapitalContributions. We calculate a **Capital Contribution Ratio (CCR)**:

$$CCR \= \\frac{\\text{Player Contribution}}{\\text{Clan Median Contribution}}$$  
A candidate with a $CCR \> 1.2$ (contributing 20% more than the median) is effectively paying a "leadership tax." This willingness to sacrifice personal progression (converting resources to Capital Gold via the Forge) for the common good is a strong predictor of benevolent leadership.

### **4.4 The "Leech" Protocol: Ratio Enforcement**

While strict 1:2 donation ratios are often considered archaic for casual members, for *leaders*, they are non-negotiable. A leader sets the example. The SCES implements a **Leech Detection** logic.28

$$Ratio \= \\frac{\\text{Donations Sent}}{\\text{Donations Received}}$$  
If $Ratio \< 0.4$ (donates less than 40% of what they take) consistently over two seasons, the SCES score is zeroed out. This acts as a "hard gate"—no matter how good a player is at war, if they are a leech, they cannot be a Co-Leader.

## ---

**5\. Module 3: Behavioral Analysis & Churn Prediction (BRM)**

The most damaging event for a clan is the sudden loss of a leader. "Ghosting" (going inactive without notice) leaves the clan paralyzed. The BRM uses machine learning concepts to predict **Churn Risk** and quantify **Stickiness**.30

### **5.1 The "Active Epoch" Heatmap**

Since the API does not provide a lastOnline timestamp, we must construct one. We define an **Active Epoch** as any time window (e.g., 1 hour) where a specific API field changes for a player.6

Triggers for an Active Epoch:

1. **Donation Delta:** donations or donationsReceived increments.  
2. **Trophy Delta:** trophies or versusTrophies changes by $\>0$.  
3. **Achievement Progress:** achievement\[name\].value increments (e.g., *Gold Grab* increases, implying a raid occurred).  
4. **War Attack:** An attack is logged in /currentwar.

By plotting these epochs over a 28-day cycle, we generate an **Activity Heatmap**.

* **Leadership Requirement:** A candidate must have Active Epochs on at least 25 of the last 28 days.  
* **Churn Warning:** If the gap between epochs exceeds 72 hours, the BRM flags the user as "High Risk."

### **5.2 Tenure and Stickiness**

Longevity allows for the accumulation of institutional knowledge. We apply a **Tenure Weighting** to the BRM.

* $0-90$ Days: Probationary Period. Promotion to Co-Leader is programmatically blocked regardless of performance.  
* $90-180$ Days: Emerging Leader.  
* $180+$ Days: Veteran.

We also analyze **Engagement Velocity** during Clan Games.

* **High Velocity:** Maxes 4,000 points in the first 48 hours. This indicates high enthusiasm.  
* **Low Velocity:** Maxes 4,000 points in the last 6 hours. This indicates procrastination or burnout.  
* **Non-Completion:** Fails to reach 4,000 points.

A leadership candidate should consistently demonstrate High or Medium Velocity. Consistent "last-minute" grinding is a precursor to churn.34

### **5.3 The "Rushed" Heuristic: Strategic Planning**

A leader must demonstrate the ability to plan long-term. In CoC, this is reflected in base management. A "Rushed" base (Town Hall level significantly outpacing defense and hero levels) indicates impulsiveness—a poor trait for leadership.36

We calculate a **Base Efficiency Score (BES)**:

$$BES \= \\frac{\\sum \\text{Hero Levels}}{\\text{Max Hero Levels for TH}}$$

* **Strategic Rusher:** High BES ($\>0.8$), Low Defense Weight. This player understands that offense \> defense. **Verdict:** Good Leader Candidate.  
* **Bad Rusher:** Low BES ($\<0.5$), High/Medium Defense Weight. This player upgraded their TH without upgrading heroes. **Verdict:** Bad Leader Candidate (Lacks planning patience).

The algorithm explicitly penalizes "Bad Rushers" because their inability to manage their own village suggests an inability to manage a clan of 50 people.

## ---

**6\. The "Sentinel" System: Technical Implementation**

To operationalize this theory, we propose a technical architecture dubbed "Sentinel." This is a lightweight, autonomous system that polls the API, warehouses data, and generates the leadership roadmap.39

### **6.1 Architecture & Stack**

The system does not require enterprise-grade hardware. It can run on a Raspberry Pi, a $5/month VPS (DigitalOcean/Linode), or AWS Lambda free tier.

* **Language:** Python 3.9+ ( leveraging the coc.py library for async API handling).39  
* **Database:** SQLite (for simple setups) or PostgreSQL (for robust warehousing).  
* **Scheduler:** standard cron or APScheduler.  
* **Notification:** Discord Webhooks (to deliver the report to the current leadership team).

### **6.2 The Data Schema**

To support the metrics described above, the database must store historical snapshots. The API only gives the *now*; the value is in the *history*.

**Table: player\_snapshots**

SQL

CREATE TABLE player\_snapshots (  
    player\_tag TEXT,  
    timestamp DATETIME,  
    th\_level INTEGER,  
    trophies INTEGER,  
    donations\_sent INTEGER,  
    donations\_received INTEGER,  
    gold\_grab\_achievement INTEGER,  
    capital\_gold\_contribution INTEGER,  
    PRIMARY KEY (player\_tag, timestamp)  
);

**Table: war\_attacks**

SQL

CREATE TABLE war\_attacks (  
    war\_id TEXT,  
    attacker\_tag TEXT,  
    defender\_tag TEXT,  
    attacker\_th INTEGER,  
    defender\_th INTEGER,  
    attacker\_map\_pos INTEGER,  
    defender\_map\_pos INTEGER,  
    stars INTEGER,  
    destruction REAL,  
    is\_fresh\_hit BOOLEAN,  
    timestamp DATETIME,  
    PRIMARY KEY (war\_id, attacker\_tag, defender\_tag)  
);

### **6.3 The "Nightly Pull" Logic**

The script should run a "Nightly Pull" to capture the daily delta of metrics.

Python

import coc  
import asyncio  
from datetime import datetime

\# Initialize Client  
client \= coc.login(email="...", password="...")

async def sentinel\_job():  
    clan \= await client.get\_clan("\#CLANTAG")  
      
    \# 1\. War Data Capture (Must check if war ended recently)  
    try:  
        \# get\_warlog is historical, get\_current\_war is live  
        war \= await client.get\_current\_war("\#CLANTAG")  
        if war.state \== 'inWar' or war.state \== 'warEnded':  
            for attack in war.attacks:  
                \# Store attack details in DB  
                \# Calculate True Star Value immediately  
                pass  
    except coc.PrivateWarLog:  
        print("Error: War Log is Private")

    \# 2\. Member Delta Capture  
    for member in clan.members:  
        \# Fetch detailed player data for achievements  
        player \= await client.get\_player(member.tag)  
          
        \# Calculate Base Efficiency Score  
        hero\_levels \= sum(\[h.level for h in player.heroes\])  
        max\_hero\_levels \= get\_max\_heroes(player.town\_hall) \# Helper function  
        bes \= hero\_levels / max\_hero\_levels  
          
        \# Log Snapshot to DB  
        save\_snapshot(member, player, bes)

    \# 3\. Churn Analysis  
    \# Compare current snapshot vs 24h ago  
    \# If no changes in Trophies/Donations/Achievements \-\> Increment 'Inactive' counter

### **6.4 The Discord Report Generator**

Once a week, the system runs the aggregation logic and posts a report to a private \#leadership channel on Discord.

* **Emerging Leaders:** List of members with CLV \> 80\.  
* **Demotion Risks:** List of members with active "Leech" or "Ghost" flags.  
* **War MVPs:** Members with the highest Glicko-2 rating improvement.

## ---

**7\. The Leadership Roadmap: From Data to Decision**

The final output of the Sentinel system is a stratified roadmap for personnel decisions. This removes the "gut feel" and replaces it with data-backed tiers.

### **7.1 Tier 1: The "Successor" (CLV \> 90\)**

**Profile:**

* **WPI:** Top 10% in Glicko-2 rating. Reliable 2-star minimum, frequent 3-star. Zero missed attacks in 6 months.  
* **SCES:** "Sustain Donor" profile. Donation ratio \> 1.0. Capital contribution \> 1.2x median.  
* **BRM:** Daily active epochs. High engagement velocity in Clan Games.  
* **Base:** Strategic/Maxed. High BES.

**Action:** *Immediate promotion to Co-Leader. Groom for eventual Leadership.* These are the unicorns of the clan ecosystem.

### **7.2 Tier 2: The "Lieutenant" (CLV 75 \- 89\)**

**Profile:**

* **WPI:** Solid war performer, but perhaps lacks the "Clutch" factor or struggles with top-tier meta strategies.  
* **SCES:** Extremely high. This is often the "Chat Moderator" or "Recruiter" who keeps the clan alive socially but isn't the best attacker.  
* **BRM:** Very stable.

**Action:** *Promote to Elder/Co-Leader.* These players are vital for clan operations (starting wars, donating) even if they aren't the strategic war generals.

### **7.3 Tier 3: The "Soldier" (CLV 50 \- 74\)**

**Profile:**

* **WPI:** Average. Hits mirrors for 2 stars.  
* **SCES:** Meets minimums (donates what is asked, does capital raids).  
* **BRM:** Consistent.

**Action:** *Maintain status.* Do not promote to leadership, as they lack the "above and beyond" traits, but value them as the core workforce.

### **7.4 Tier 4: The "Liability" (CLV \< 40\) \- Demotion Targets**

**Profile:**

* **WPI:** Frequently misses attacks or scores 0-1 star. High variance.  
* **SCES:** "Leech" flag active. Ratio \< 0.4.  
* **BRM:** "Ghost" flag active (gaps of \> 5 days inactive).

**Action:** *Demote to Member. If already Member, Kick.* The algorithm identifies these players impartially, allowing the Leader to say, "The system flagged you for inactivity/performance," depersonalizing the conflict.

## ---

**8\. Conclusion**

Programmatically determining leadership in *Clash of Clans* is not about identifying the player with the highest trophy count or the most expensive skin. It is about identifying **structural value**. By implementing the **Clan Leadership Succession Algorithm (CLSA)**, a clan transitions from a chaotic social group to a disciplined, data-driven organization.

The "cleverness" of this approach lies in the synthesis of disparate data points: combining the immediacy of **War Performance (WPI)** with the longevity of **Economic Contribution (SCES)** and the subtlety of **Behavioral Reliability (BRM)**.

**Recommendations for Immediate Implementation:**

1. **Deploy the Sentinel Script:** Start collecting nightly snapshots immediately. The algorithms need at least 30 days of data to establish valid baselines for Glicko-2 and Churn Prediction.  
2. **Define Your Weights:** Adjust the CLV formula weights based on your clan's culture. A "War Clan" might weight WPI at 60%; a "Farming Clan" might weight SCES at 60%.  
3. **Automate the "Ghost" Purge:** Use the BRM to identify and kick inactive players first. This clears the roster for new talent and improves overall clan metrics immediately.

This framework provides a definitive, mathematical roadmap for leadership succession, ensuring that the mantle of authority falls to those who have statistically proven they can carry the weight.

### **9\. Appendix: Detailed CLV Formula**

The **Composite Leadership Value (CLV)** is calculated as follows:

$$CLV \= (WPI\_{norm} \\times w\_1) \+ (SCES\_{norm} \\times w\_2) \+ (BRM\_{norm} \\times w\_3)$$  
**Recommended Weights:**

* **War Performance ($w\_1$):** 0.35 (Skill is essential but not sufficient).  
* **Social/Economic ($w\_2$):** 0.25 (Selflessness creates culture).  
* **Behavioral Reliability ($w\_3$):** 0.40 (Reliability is the most critical trait for leadership).

Normalization:  
All sub-scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale using Min-Max scaling against the clan's population range to ensure fair comparison within the specific context of your clan's level.

$$X\_{norm} \= \\frac{X \- X\_{min}}{X\_{max} \- X\_{min}} \\times 100$$  
This ensures that the "best" donor in a low-activity clan is still recognized as a leader relative to their peers, preserving the internal meritocracy.
