## Advanced Clan Management Roadmap

### Next-Level Clan Leader Dashboard - Strategic Vision

This comprehensive roadmap outlines advanced metrics and features that could transform the clan management dashboard into a strategic command center. These ideas go beyond basic stats to provide actionable insights for clan leadership.

#### War Performance: New Efficiency Metrics

**Attack Efficiency Index**
- Average stars earned per attack (total war stars / total attacks)
- Track improvement over time to measure strategy effectiveness
- Example: 55 stars from 28 attacks = ~1.96 stars per attack

**Contribution Consistency Score**
- Measure steadiness of each player's war performance
- Standard deviation of stars per war or streak counting
- Identify clutch players vs. streaky performers for better war assignments

**Stars per Town Hall Difference**
- Track performance when hitting up or down in war
- Calculate averages by TH differential (e.g., +1 TH = 1.4‚≠ê, -1 TH = 2.9‚≠ê)
- Identify over-performers who excel against higher-level bases

**Cleanup Efficiency**
- Percentage of remaining stars secured on second attempts
- Measure teamwork and planning effectiveness
- Low cleanup rate indicates wasted attacks or poor target selection

**Defensive Hold Rate**
- Track how often each base avoids being 3-starred
- Identify strong base designs to share as defensive MVPs
- Example: "TH13 bases held without being tripled in 3 of 5 wars"

#### Clan Capital: Attack Effectiveness Metrics

**Average Capital Loot per Attack**
- Individual and clan-wide capital gold per attack
- Bar chart visualization to identify top performers
- Encourage strategy sharing between high and low performers

**One-Hit District Clear Rate**
- Percentage of districts destroyed in single attacks
- Breakdown by district type to identify optimization opportunities
- Track improvement as troop levels and strategies evolve

**Attack-to-Destruction Efficiency**
- Average destruction percentage per attack
- Measure coordination and systematic approach
- Track impact of new troop unlocks and strategies

**Player "Carry" Score**
- Quantify individual contribution relative to others
- Combine share of total loot, districts destroyed, and finishing attacks
- Identify heroes and potential burnout risks

**Raid Participation Rate**
- Proportion of eligible capital attacks actually used
- Track engagement and ensure maximum raid rewards
- Flag members who consistently leave attacks unused

#### Player Engagement & Activity Metrics

**Donation Balance & Ratio**
- Donation balance = troops donated - troops received
- Donation ratio (donated:received) for fair assessment
- Track trends over time to spot improving or declining habits

**Attack Participation Rate**
- Combine war and capital participation into single engagement score
- Percentage of attacks used out of total possible
- Identify consistently low participation for intervention

**Builder Base vs. Main Base Activity Skew**
- Ratio of Builder Base trophies to Main Base trophies
- Identify specialists (e.g., Builder Base experts for Capital raids)
- Personalize engagement understanding

**Town Hall Progress Efficiency (Rush Index)**
- Combine experience level, heroes/troops level, and TH level
- Identify rushed vs. efficiently developed bases
- Flag war liabilities and upgrade priorities

**Hero Upgrade Downtime**
- Track hero availability in wars over time
- Encourage smart timing of upgrades or book usage
- Measure dedication to war readiness

#### Trend & Progress Tracking (Longitudinal Metrics)

**War Performance Trends**
- Plot Attack Efficiency and total stars over time
- Individual sparklines showing 3-war rolling averages
- Identify slumps and improvements for proactive intervention

**Donation Trends**
- Monthly donated and received totals per member
- Side-by-side bar charts to spot patterns
- Identify burnout or absence through donation drops

**Clan Capital Progress**
- Track total capital gold looted per season
- Monitor average attacks used per member each weekend
- Identify participation issues and re-engagement needs

**Membership and Town Hall Evolution**
- Timeline of clan composition changes
- Stacked area chart of TH level distribution over time
- Track new joins and departures for stability insights

**Performance vs. Opposition Level**
- Stars earned relative to enemy clan strength in CWL
- Track progress against tougher competition over seasons
- Identify if clan is closing gaps or plateauing

**Individual Improvement Highlights**
- Automatic flagging of notable personal trends
- Celebrate progress and call attention to concerns
- Use trend data for recognition and intervention

#### Roster Composition & Recruitment Metrics

**Town Hall Spread & "Weight" Gaps**
- Calculate weight gap between top and bottom war bases
- Identify optimal TH band for war matching
- Flag significant holes in roster (e.g., no TH15s)

**Role Coverage (Offense/Defense)**
- Analyze if clan has enough of each "role"
- Check for optimal TH15 slots filled
- Identify defensive gaps and diversification needs

**Sandbagger/Efficiency Alerts**
- Flag overpowered members (sandbaggers) affecting war weight
- Identify underpowered members (rushed) for war planning
- Help prioritize donations and coaching

**Overall Contribution Score**
- Composite metric rolling up war, donations, and capital contributions
- Point system: +3 per war attack, +2 per war star, +1 per 1k donation net, etc.
- Create "Clan MVP index" leaderboard for motivation

**Recruitment Priorities**
- Generate actionable insights for leaders
- Example: "Low on TH14/15 - recruit 2 high-level players before next CWL"
- Turn raw metrics into strategic to-dos

## Development Guidelines
- **CRITICAL: JSX Structure Safety** - When working on JSX structure, be extra careful and think, re-think code so that syntax doesn't break the site. Always verify function braces, component structure, and return statements are properly nested before testing.
