Ok # Clash Intelligence Dashboard - Development Ideas

## What's New (Unreleased)
### Security + API hardening sweep (2025‚Äë09‚Äë15)
- Production security headers: CSP, HSTS, X‚ÄëFrame‚ÄëOptions, Referrer‚ÄëPolicy, Permissions‚ÄëPolicy; disabled `x-powered-by`.
- Standardized API response shape: every hot route returns `ApiResponse<T>` with `{ success, data?, error?, message?, requestId? }`.
- Zod‚Äëvalidated inputs across routes; consistent 400/401/403/404/429 semantics.
- Durable inbound rate limiting via Upstash Redis with in‚Äëmemory fallback; applied to roster, snapshots, departures, AI, sync, uploads, migrations.
- SSR roster snapshot‚Äëfirst bootstrap for fast first paint; `lib/roster.ts` helper.
- Leadership middleware (opt‚Äëin via `LEADERSHIP_TOKEN`) guarding admin/write endpoints.
- Structured JSON request logging with `requestId`; pluggable transport (provider hook), console JSON fallback.
- Fix: CoC client uses IPv4 for native fetch; proxy path uses axios + https‚Äëproxy‚Äëagent.
- Breaking: Roster and other APIs return `{ success, data }`‚Äîexternal consumers must read `json.data`.

### RequestId + ApiResponse standardization (details)
- Helper: `createApiContext(req, route)` provides `{ logger, json }`.
  - `json(body, init?)` injects `requestId` into body and sets `x-request-id` header.
  - `logger` emits structured JSON logs with consistent fields: `level, msg, route, path, ip, requestId, ts`.
- Updated routes to use helper: roster, snapshots (list/create/changes), departures (+notifications), AI (summary/coaching/batch-results/dna-cache), sync/heroes, tenure (map/save/seed/update), health, diag (ip/env), access (init/list), player‚Äëresolver, player/[tag], upload‚Äësnapshots, migrate‚Äëdepartures, cron/daily‚Äësnapshot, ip‚Äëtest, debug (data/player).
- Middleware 401s include `requestId` and set `x-request-id`.

### Read‚Äëside caching
- Added tiny wrapper `cached(key, fn, ttlSeconds)` over `next/cache` `unstable_cache` for brief deduping on hot reads.
- Applied conservatively (defaults 10s): snapshots list (Supabase), snapshot/tenure reads in roster snapshot path, snapshot changes (by‚Äëdate/all), departures list, player‚Äëresolver file, departures/notifications roster fetch, tenure ledger lines, AI batch‚Äëresults.

### Logging transport (provider‚Äëready)
- `src/lib/logger.ts` now supports a pluggable provider via `globalThis.__structuredLogger` with `info|warn|error|debug(payload)`; falls back to console JSON.
- Keep current logs but future‚Äëproof for pino or hosted transports without touching call sites.

### MCP compatibility
- `web-next/mcp-server.js` updated to read `response.data` for roster and activity changes (breaking change consumer fix).

- Header overhaul: two-row, full-width with centered clan name; controls right-aligned and compact.
- Tabs visually ‚Äúglued‚Äù to header via gradient seam; still render below.
- Clan logo support: detects `/clans/<safeTag>.*` and common root paths, with fallback to `/clan-logo.png`.
- Shared gradient variable `--header-gradient` and utility `.bg-header-gradient`.
- Data Source toggle (Live/Snapshot) added to header.
- Toast notifications: `lib/toast.ts` + `components/layout/ToastHub.tsx`.
- Build/type fixes: td `title` support, client directives, store rehydrate typing.
- Version display wired to `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION`; scripts inject version and add `release:*` helpers.
- Consider introducing a Settings gear entry point to consolidate defaults, permission controls, and other configuration toggles.

- [ ] **CRITICAL: Fix dashboard auto-loading** - Dashboard should auto-load latest snapshot data on startup but currently shows empty

### 2025-09-14 Updates
- [x] Hardened change detection: normalize tags to uppercase when diffing snapshots to ensure joins/leaves are correctly detected regardless of case drift.
- [x] Snapshot-first loading: `loadRoster()` now attempts `mode=snapshot&date=latest` by default and falls back to live if no snapshot exists. Status messages indicate the data source.
- [x] Centralized tag handling: Added `lib/tags.ts` and refactored API/routes/libs to use shared helpers (normalize, validate, filenames).
- [x] Extracted rate limiter: Shared `lib/rate-limiter.ts` imported by APIs for consistent pacing.
- [x] Data-source policy: `lib/data-source-policy.ts` decides snapshot/live fetch order; store uses it for clarity.
- [x] Added focused unit tests: tags utils and mixed-case snapshot change detection.
- [x] Clean tab nav: hide leadership-only tabs for non-leaders; renamed "AI Coaching" to "Coaching".

### Structural Improvements (Modularity/SOLID)
- **Tag utilities**: Centralize clan/player tag normalization (uppercasing, prefix handling) in a small util to avoid divergent logic across API, store, and detectors.
- **Data source policy**: Encapsulated snapshot-vs-live selection and fallback in a dedicated module used by the store.
- **Rate limiter boundary**: Extracted a reusable limiter. Next, consider standardizing around limiter-only and removing ad-hoc `mapLimit` where it duplicates pacing logic.
- **Typed domain models**: Share `Member`/`Roster` types across API/Store/Components to prevent optional/nullable drift and ease future analytics features.
- **Observability hooks**: Add minimal debug logs and timings behind `ENABLE_DEBUG_LOGGING` to trace cache hits, limiter waits, and data source decisions.

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor rate limiting to use Redis
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Add comprehensive error monitoring
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functions

## Advanced Clan Management Roadmap

### Next-Level Clan Leader Dashboard - Strategic Vision

This comprehensive roadmap outlines advanced metrics and features that could transform the clan management dashboard into a strategic command center. These ideas go beyond basic stats to provide actionable insights for clan leadership.

#### War Performance: New Efficiency Metrics

**Attack Efficiency Index**
- Average stars earned per attack (total war stars / total attacks)
- Track improvement over time to measure strategy effectiveness
- Example: 55 stars from 28 attacks = ~1.96 stars per attack

**Contribution Consistency Score**
- Measure steadiness of each player's war performance
- Standard deviation of stars per war or streak counting
- Identify clutch players vs. streaky performers for better war assignments

**Stars per Town Hall Difference**
- Track performance when hitting up or down in war
- Calculate averages by TH differential (e.g., +1 TH = 1.4‚≠ê, -1 TH = 2.9‚≠ê)
- Identify over-performers who excel against higher-level bases

**Cleanup Efficiency**
- Percentage of remaining stars secured on second attempts
- Measure teamwork and planning effectiveness
- Low cleanup rate indicates wasted attacks or poor target selection

**Defensive Hold Rate**
- Track how often each base avoids being 3-starred
- Identify strong base designs to share as defensive MVPs
- Example: "TH13 bases held without being tripled in 3 of 5 wars"

#### Clan Capital: Attack Effectiveness Metrics

**Average Capital Loot per Attack**
- Individual and clan-wide capital gold per attack
- Bar chart visualization to identify top performers
- Encourage strategy sharing between high and low performers

**One-Hit District Clear Rate**
- Percentage of districts destroyed in single attacks
- Breakdown by district type to identify optimization opportunities
- Track improvement as troop levels and strategies evolve

- Measure dedication to war readiness

#### Trend & Progress Tracking (Longitudinal Metrics)

**War Performance Trends**
- Plot Attack Efficiency and total stars over time
- Individual sparklines showing 3-war rolling averages
- Identify slumps and improvements for proactive intervention

**Donation Trends**
- Monthly donated and received totals per member
- Side-by-side bar charts to spot patterns
- Identify burnout or absence through donation drops

**Clan Capital Progress**

- Track progress against tougher competition over seasons
- Identify if clan is closing gaps or plateauing

**Individual Improvement Highlights**
- Automatic flagging of notable personal trends
- Celebrate progress and call attention to concerns
- Use trend data for recognition and intervention

#### Roster Composition & Recruitment Metrics

**Town Hall Spread & "Weight" Gaps**
- Calculate weight gap between top and bottom war bases
- Identify optimal TH band for war matching
- Flag significant holes in roster (e.g., no TH15s)

**Role Coverage (Offense/Defense)**
- Analyze if clan has enough of each "role"
- Check for optimal TH15 slots filled
- Identify defensive gaps and diversification needs

**Sandbagger/Efficiency Alerts**
- Flag overpowered members (sandbaggers) affecting war weight
- Identify underpowered members (rushed) for war planning
- Help prioritize donations and coaching

**Overall Contribution Score**
- Composite metric rolling up war, donations, and capital contributions
- Point system: +3 per war attack, +2 per war star, +1 per 1k donation net, etc.
- Create "Clan MVP index" leaderboard for motivation

**Recruitment Priorities**
- Generate actionable insights for leaders
- Example: "Low on TH14/15 - recruit 2 high-level players before next CWL"

## üöÄ **REVOLUTIONARY ANALYTICS VISION (NEW)**

### **üß¨ Player DNA Fingerprinting System**
**Concept**: Each member gets a unique "DNA profile" across six dimensions with radar visualization
- **Balanced Titans**: Perfect leadership + performance + generosity combo (like DoubleD)
- **Alpha Donors**: Leaders who give massive donations (like warfroggy with 293 donations)
- **Paradox Players**: Take all donations but deliver highest capital performance (like Zouboul)
- **Silent Warriors**: Elite performance with zero social engagement (like War.Frog)
- **Innovation**: First-ever multi-dimensional player classification predicting behavior patterns

### **üéØ Clan Momentum Matrix**
**Concept**: Revolutionary quadrant analysis revealing clan's performance DNA across zones
- **Domination Zone**: High stars + high destruction (where you want to be)
- **Grinding Zone**: High destruction but lower stars (current position - good offense, needs strategy)
- **Performance Pattern**: Tie-heavy recent record indicates perfectly matched opponents
- **Innovation**: Real-time war momentum tracking with predictive win probability

### **üåê Social Ecosystem Flow Network**
**Concept**: Most enlightening discovery - perfect donation economy analysis
- 4 players give ALL 643 donations
- 1 player receives ALL 643 donations
- Mathematical perfect balance reveals hidden social contract
- 15 players are donation-neutral (massive untapped resource)
- **Innovation**: First-ever social fairness quantification with relationship strength mapping

### **üè∞ Capital Raid Efficiency Matrix**
**Concept**: Heatmap revealing performance paradoxes
- **Zouboul**: Lowest social contributor but HIGHEST capital performer (30K loot)
- **CosmicThomas**: Highest attack efficiency (2.17 stars/attack)
- Only 35% of clan participates in capital raids (huge opportunity)
- **Innovation**: Multi-dimensional efficiency scoring revealing hidden talents

### **üéÆ Game-Changing Dashboard Widgets**
1. **Clan Chemistry Heat Map**: Real-time social network showing donation flows, attack collaborations, chat interactions
2. **Member Archetype AI Classifier**: Automatically categorizes players as Titans, Grinders, Socials, Specialists, Potentials
3. **Momentum Flow Dashboard**: Live performance trends with predictive algorithms
4. **Resource Flow Ecosystem**: Donation network visualization with fairness scores
5. **Capital Raid ROI Matrix**: Economic analysis showing cost-benefit of each attack

### **üîÆ Predictive Intelligence Features**
- **Player Burnout Prediction**: Tracks engagement velocity changes to prevent member loss
- **War Outcome Forecasting**: Based on lineup composition + current momentum
- **Recruitment Fit Analysis**: Recommends ideal new member profiles
- **Clan Health Score**: Overall ecosystem stability metrics with early warning alerts

### **üí° Revolutionary Insights Integration**
- **Hidden Clan Economy**: 4 top donors create sustainable ecosystem supporting 16 other members
- **Performance Paradox**: Highest capital performer is also biggest social taker (strategic specialization works)
- **Momentum Pattern**: Tie-heavy wars indicate perfect matchmaking but untapped potential
- **Growth Opportunity**: Zero TH15 players and 65% non-capital participation represent massive competitive advantages

**Implementation Priority**: These revolutionary concepts could be implemented as **Phase 2** after Leadership Team Access Control, transforming the dashboard from reactive clan management to **predictive intelligence platform**.

## Future Vision & Wish List

### 1. Multi-Tenant SaaS Version
**Goal**: Offer the dashboard to other clan leaders as a service
- **Setup Wizard**: New users enter their own API keys and configuration
- **Isolated Instances**: Each clan gets their own data environment

## Development Guidelines
- **CRITICAL: JSX Structure Safety** - When working on JSX structure, be extra careful and think, re-think code so that syntax doesn't break the site. Always verify function braces, component structure, and return statements are properly nested before testing.

- **CRITICAL: TypeScript Compatibility** - NEVER make incompatible changes between environments. Always ensure TypeScript code compiles correctly before committing. Test builds locally before pushing to prevent Vercel deployment failures. All variables must be properly defined and typed.

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow (NEW - v0.16.1)

### Multi-Environment Setup
- **Development**: Local development with test data
- **Staging**: Vercel preview deployments for testing
- **Production**: Live application with real data

### Safe Development Process
1. **Never develop directly in production** - Use staging environment
2. **Feature branches** - Create branches for new features
3. **Staging testing** - Always test in staging before production
4. **Environment variables** - Separate configs for each environment

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Local development
npm run dev

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:prod

# Check environment
npm run env:check
```

### Environment Configuration
- Copy `env.example` to `.env.local` for local development
- Configure Vercel environment variables for staging/production
- Use different API keys and database instances for each environment

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete deployment guide.
### Applicant Evaluation (new feature)
- Endpoint: `GET /api/applicants/evaluate?tag=#PLAYER_TAG&clanTag=#CLAN_TAG`
  - Returns `{ success, data: { applicant, evaluation }, requestId }` where `evaluation = { score (0-100), recommendation ('Excellent'|'Good'|'Fair'|'Poor'), breakdown: [{ category, points, maxPoints, details }] }`.
  - Input validation via Zod; inbound rate limited; uses `requestId` helper.
  - Clan context is optional; when provided, uses latest snapshot (if available) to compute ‚ÄúClan Fit‚Äù vs average TH; otherwise treated neutral.
- UI: Applicant tab now includes an evaluation panel
  - Component: `src/components/ApplicantsPanel.tsx`
  - Enter player tag (and optional clan tag), hit Evaluate; shows score, recommendation, and category breakdown.
  - Consumes the new API and respects standardized `ApiResponse` shape.
  - One-click "Save to Player DB": stores an applicant note in localStorage under `player_notes_<TAG>` and name under `player_name_<TAG>`. View saved applicants in the Player Database tab.
  - Discord copy: "Copy Discord Blurb" creates a short, readable message with score, TH, trophies, hero levels, strengths and a top gap.
  - Applicant status: choose status (shortlisted/consider-later/hired/rejected); saved alongside the note and editable from Player Database modal.
  - Shortlist Builder: Build a ranked shortlist from locally saved candidates (status shortlisted/consider-later), parameterized Top N.
    - API: `POST /api/applicants/shortlist { clanTag?, tags: string[], top? }` returns `{ shortlist: [{ applicant, evaluation }] }`.
    - UI: Button on Applicants tab; copies individual blurbs; uses standardized `ApiResponse` and requestId.
  - Scan External Clan: Type a clan tag, fetch roster, score all, return Top N.
    - API: `GET /api/applicants/scan-clan?sourceClanTag=#&contextClanTag=#&top=20`
    - Filters supported on both shortlist + scan: `minTh`, `maxTh`, `minScore`, `minTrophies`, and `includeRoles` (member, elder, coleader, leader).
    - UI: Filter inputs (TH, score, trophies) and role checkboxes (leaders/co-leaders off by default).
- Scoring logic
  - Location: `src/lib/applicants.ts`
  - Criteria and weights: Town Hall (25), Hero Development (30) vs TH caps, Trophy Count (20), Clan Fit vs avg TH (15), Activity via donations (10).
  - Uses `HERO_MAX_LEVELS` from `src/types`.

## Deployment Strategy (Updated January 2025)

### Preview Deployment Workflow
**Cost**: FREE - No additional charges for preview deployments

**Workflow**:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "feat: your feature description"`
3. Push branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
4. **Vercel automatically creates preview URL**: `https://clash-intelligence-[hash]-dougs-projects.vercel.app`
5. Test on preview URL before merging
6. Merge to main: `git checkout main && git merge feature/your-feature-name`
7. Push main: `git push origin main` ‚Üí Deploys to production
8. Delete feature branch: `git branch -D feature/your-feature-name`

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Zero additional cost
- ‚úÖ Automatic preview URLs for every feature branch
- ‚úÖ Test changes safely before production
- ‚úÖ No manual configuration needed
- ‚úÖ Better than staging (unique URL per feature)

**Production URLs**:
- Main production: `https://clash-intelligence-new.vercel.app`
- Preview deployments: `https://clash-intelligence-[hash]-dougs-projects.vercel.app`

**Environment Variables**: All environments (production, preview) automatically inherit the same environment variables from Vercel project settings.

### Future: Discord-Based Authentication & Auto Access
- Discord bot command `/link <playerTag>` issues a signed one-time URL that ties `discordId` to the clan roster tag; visiting the link sets a session cookie.
- Sessions derive permissions automatically from Supabase roster snapshots (leader/coleader/elder/member) so tabs/access update instantly; leaving the clan revokes access on the next request.
- Keep Access Manager for manual overrides and external viewers; `/unlink` command or roster removal tears down sessions immediately.
