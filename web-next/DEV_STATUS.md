# Dev Status (auto-updated)

**Last update:** 2026-02-04 10:00 EST

## Current
- Next dev server: **RUNNING** (port 5050)
- Watchdog: **RUNNING** (auto-restarts next dev if killed)
- Focus: **/new/roster spec2 parity** (cards + table)

## What I'm working on
- Tightening cards view to match spec2: filter bar / action menus / spacing.

## How to check quickly
- If `http://127.0.0.1:5050/new/roster` loads → dev server is up.
- If it does not load → dev server likely down; ping me.

## Notes
- SIGKILLs happen; watchdog should bring dev back automatically.
