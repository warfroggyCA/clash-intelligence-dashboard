# Phase 1: Player History API Enhancement - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the `/api/player/[tag]/history` endpoint to provide comprehensive historical data for individual players, ready for use in building the player profile pages with charts.

## What Was Done

### 1. Enhanced Data Structure
**Old structure** (basic):
- Only: trophies, donations, donationsReceived, warStars, clanCapitalContributions, townHallLevel, role

**New structure** (comprehensive):
- **Town Hall & Role**: townHallLevel, role
- **Trophies**: Regular trophies + ranked trophies + ranked league info (ID & name)
- **Donations**: donations, donationsReceived
- **War & Capital**: warStars, clanCapitalContributions (preserved for backward compatibility)
- **Heroes**: Complete hero levels (BK, AQ, GW, RC, MP)
- **Progression Metrics**: rushPercent, activityScore
- **Deltas**: Calculated changes between snapshots including:
  - Trophy changes (regular + ranked)
  - Donation changes
  - Hero upgrades with specific levels (e.g., "BK: 65 → 67")
  - Town Hall upgrades (boolean flag)
  - Role changes (boolean flag)

### 2. Dual Data Source Support
The API now intelligently queries:
1. **Primary**: New `roster_snapshots` + `member_snapshot_stats` tables (comprehensive data)
2. **Fallback**: Old `full_snapshots` table (basic data for backward compatibility)

Returns `dataSource` in metadata to indicate which source was used.

### 3. Enhanced Query Parameters
- `days`: Number of days of history (default: 30, max: 365, increased from 90)
- `includeDeltas`: Calculate deltas between snapshots (default: true)

### 4. Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "date": "2025-10-12",
      "fetchedAt": "2025-10-12T19:22:47.376+00:00",
      "townHallLevel": 14,
      "role": "member",
      "trophies": 0,
      "rankedTrophies": 0,

      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {

    "days": 60,
    "dataPointsFound": 56,
    "dataSource": "roster_snapshots",
    "includeDeltas": true
  }
}
```

## Testing Results

### Test 1: Basic Query (30 days)
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/player/%23UU9GJ9QQ/history?days=30'
```
✅ **Result**: Retrieved 56 historical data points with comprehensive stats

### Test 2: Extended Query (60 days with deltas)
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/player/%23UU9GJ9QQ/history?days=60&includeDeltas=true'
```
✅ **Result**: Retrieved 56 data points with delta calculations

### Test 3: Hero Upgrades Detection
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:3000/api/player/%23VGQVRLRL/history?days=30'
```
✅ **Result**: Successfully detected hero upgrades:
- BK: 65 → 67
- AQ: 75 → 76
- MP: 54 → 57

## Data Ready for Frontend

The API now provides all data needed for:
1. **Trophy Charts**: Regular and ranked trophy progression
2. **Donation Charts**: Donations given/received over time
3. **Hero Progression**: Individual hero level tracking with upgrade events
4. **Activity Timeline**: Activity scores over time
5. **League Progression**: Ranked league changes
6. **Milestone Detection**: Town Hall upgrades, role changes, hero upgrades

## Next Steps (Phase 2 - Frontend)

With the backend ready, Phase 2 will implement:
1. Player profile page UI at `/app/web-next/src/app/player/[tag]/page.tsx`
2. Shadcn UI chart components for visualizations
3. Historical views for:
   - Trophy progression (line chart)
   - War history timeline (if data becomes available)
   - Donation trends (line chart)
   - Hero progression (multi-line chart or timeline)
   - Activity history (line chart)
4. Navigation integration

## Technical Notes

- **TypeScript**: Updated `HistoricalDataPoint` interface with comprehensive types
- **Null Safety**: All nullable fields properly typed
- **Performance**: Efficient queries using member_id joins
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fallback to old `full_snapshots` table ensures no data loss
- **Scalability**: Supports up to 365 days of history

## Files Modified
- `/app/web-next/src/app/api/player/[tag]/history/route.ts` - Complete rewrite with enhanced logic
