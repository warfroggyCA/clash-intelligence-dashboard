### **About the "Preview":**
- The cloud preview at `preview.emergentagent.com` was specific to the original development session
- **You (new agent) will NOT have access to that preview environment**
- To see the work: User must push to GitHub first, then view at https://heckyeah.clashintelligence.com
- Or user can run locally: `cd /Users/dougfindlay/New\ Clash\ Intelligence/web-next && npm run dev`

### **Your Job (If You're the UI/UX Agent):**
1. ✅ DO: Review the production site for accessibility/contrast/UX issues
2. ✅ DO: Create prioritized list of fixes needed
3. ✅ DO: Implement HIGH and CRITICAL fixes
4. ❌ DON'T: Try to rebuild Command Center (it's done)
5. ❌ DON'T: Ask user to push to GitHub until you have fixes ready
6. ❌ DON'T: Expect to access the cloud preview (you can't)

## 🎯 What Was Built This Session

### **✅ COMPLETED FEATURES (Ready, Tested, Working)**

These are DONE and exist in the codebase. User has NOT pushed to GitHub yet, so they're NOT on production.

### **1. Command Center (Complete Redesign) - ✅ 100% DONE**

**Problem:** 
- Old "Coaching" tab showed stale AI-generated advice from October 2024
- Generic messages like "welcome new members" with no actionable intelligence
- Required manual button click to generate
- AI-dependent (failed when OpenAI unavailable)

**Solution:**
Created a real-time intelligence dashboard with:

#### **Files Created:**

**`/app/web-next/src/lib/clan-metrics.ts`** (421 lines)
- Pure data analysis engine (no AI dependency)
- Functions:
  - `calculateClanHealth()` - Activity, donations, rush index, membership health
  - `getTopPerformers()` - Identifies top donators, trophy leaders, active players
  - `generateWatchlist()` - Members needing attention (inactive, low donations, at-risk)
  - `calculateMomentum()` - Trend indicators (activity, donations, retention)
  - `getElderPromotionCandidates()` - Qualified members based on activity/donations/tenure
  - `calculateHeroDeficit()` - Rush percentage calculation
  - `calculateThCaps()` - TH-specific hero caps

**`/app/web-next/src/lib/alerts-engine.ts`** (268 lines)
- Automated alert detection system
- 6 alert categories:
  1. Inactivity alerts (7+ days, 14+ days)
  2. Donation imbalance warnings
  3. Rushed base detection (TH13+)
  4. Elder promotion opportunities
  5. At-risk member identification (3-7 days inactive)
  6. New member welcome reminders
- Priority-based sorting (high/medium/low)
- Actionable recommendations for each alert

**`/app/web-next/src/components/CommandCenter.tsx`** (598 lines)
- Main UI component
- Sections:
  - Header with data freshness indicator
  - Critical alerts (expandable cards)
  - Clan health metrics (4 key indicators)
  - Top performers showcase
  - Watchlist with severity levels
  - Momentum indicators with trend arrows
  - Elder promotion candidates
  - Quick actions (placeholder)
- Shows player names instead of tags (fixed in last update)

#### **Files Modified:**

**`/app/web-next/src/lib/tab-config.ts`**
```typescript
// Changed from:
label: 'Coaching',
icon: '💡',

// To:
label: 'Command Center',
icon: '🎯',
```

**`/app/web-next/src/app/ClientDashboard.tsx`**
```typescript
// Added import:
import CommandCenter from '@/components/CommandCenter';

// Changed routing:
case 'coaching':
  return <CommandCenter clanData={roster} clanTag={clanTag || homeClan || initialClanTag} />;
```

### **2. Nightly Automation (Fixed & Ready) - ✅ 95% DONE**

**STATUS:** Code is fixed and ready. Waiting on user to configure environment variables.

**Problem:**
- Nightly automation was 90% built but not working
- Path mismatch: `vercel.json` pointed to `/api/cron/nightly-ingestion` but endpoint was `/api/cron/daily-ingestion`
- Missing environment variables

**Solution:**

**`/app/web-next/vercel.json`** - Fixed path:
```json
"crons": [
  {
    "path": "/api/cron/daily-ingestion",  // Fixed from nightly-ingestion
    "schedule": "0 3 * * *"  // 3 AM UTC = 10 PM EST
  }
]
```

**Configuration Required (User must do):**
1. Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables
2. Apply Supabase migration for tenure columns
3. Optionally configure GitHub Actions secrets

**Status:** Code ready, waiting for environment variable configuration

---

### **3. UI Polish & Fixes - ✅ 100% DONE**

**STATUS:** All completed and tested in dev environment.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Tab Rename:** "Insights" → "Coaching" → "Command Center"
2. **Dark Mode Fix:** App now defaults to dark mode (removed system preference detection)
3. **Activity Icon:** Discord Activity Report ⚡ → 🏁
4. **Sort Column Polish:** Removed thick blue borders from active sort columns
5. **Trophy Text:** Changed to gold color (`text-clash-gold`) for better visibility
6. **Player Names:** Show names instead of tags in alerts (e.g., "PlayerA" not "#ABC123")

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/web-next/src/app/layout.tsx` - Dark mode initialization
- `/app/web-next/src/lib/contexts/theme-context.tsx` - Default theme
- `/app/web-next/src/components/roster/TableRow.tsx` - Trophy colors
- `/app/web-next/src/components/roster/TableHeader.tsx` - Sort column styling
- `/app/web-next/src/components/DiscordPublisher.tsx` - Activity icon

- ⚠️ Quick Actions buttons are placeholders
- ⚠️ Momentum calculations are basic (will improve with historical data)

### **Overall App:**
1. **Mobile Optimization** - Needs work (30% complete)
2. **Testing** - No automated tests
3. **Error Handling** - Basic, needs improvement
4. **Documentation** - User guides missing
5. **Performance** - Build times still 5-6 minutes (acceptable but not ideal)

### **Environment Variables:**

**Vercel (Production):**
- `CRON_SECRET` - ⚠️ NEEDS TO BE ADDED
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - ✅ Present
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - ✅ Present
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - ✅ Present
- `COC_API_KEY` - ✅ Present
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - ✅ Present (optional)
- `ADMIN_API_KEY` - ✅ Present

**Supabase Migration Pending:**
```sql
-- Still needs to be run:
alter table public.members
  add column if not exists tenure_days integer default 0,
  add column if not exists tenure_as_of date;

alter table public.member_snapshot_stats
  add column if not exists tenure_days integer default 0,
  add column if not exists tenure_as_of date;
```

## 🚀 How to Continue Development

### **For Next Agent:**

**1. Local Development:**
```bash
cd /Users/dougfindlay/New\ Clash\ Intelligence/web-next
npm run dev  # Runs on localhost:5050
```

**2. Cloud Development (if needed):**
```bash
cd /app/web-next
npm run dev  # Runs on port 3000 or 5050
```

**3. Push Changes:**
```bash
# Always use "Save to GitHub" button in Emergent chat
# Vercel auto-deploys on push to main branch
```

**4. Test Production:**
- URL: https://heckyeah.clashintelligence.com
- Command Center: Click 🎯 tab at top

### **If Building War Analytics (Next Priority):**

1. **Study existing war data:**
   - Check `/app/web-next/src/lib/` for war-related utilities
   - Review Supabase schema: `wars` and `war_attacks` tables
   - Look at `snapshotDetails.currentWar` and `snapshotDetails.warLog`

2. **Create war metrics calculator:**
   - New file: `/app/web-next/src/lib/war-metrics.ts`
   - Calculate: attack efficiency, consistency, cleanup rate
   - Similar pattern to `clan-metrics.ts`

3. **Integrate into Command Center:**
   - Add war alerts to `alerts-engine.ts`
   - Update Command Center to show war performance section
   - Add war metrics to clan health dashboard

4. **Create dedicated War Analytics page:**
   - New component: `/app/web-next/src/components/WarAnalytics.tsx`
   - Visual charts (use Recharts library)
   - Player-by-player attack breakdown
   - Historical war performance trends

---

## 📚 Important Code Patterns

### **1. Adding New Metrics:**

```typescript
// In clan-metrics.ts or similar:
export function calculateNewMetric(members: Member[]): MetricResult {
  // 1. Filter/map data
  const relevantMembers = members.filter(m => /* criteria */);
  
  // 2. Calculate
  const value = relevantMembers.reduce((sum, m) => sum + m.someValue, 0);
  
  // 3. Return structured result
  return {
    value,
    trend: value > threshold ? 'up' : 'down',
    description: `Human-readable description`
  };
}
```

### **2. Adding New Alerts:**

```typescript
// In alerts-engine.ts:
function detectNewIssue(context: AlertContext): Alert[] {
  const alerts: Alert[] = [];
  
  // 1. Identify problematic members
  const problemMembers = context.members.filter(m => /* condition */);
  
  // 2. If threshold met, create alert
  if (problemMembers.length >= 3) {
    alerts.push({
      id: `alert-type-${Date.now()}`,
      priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
      category: 'war' | 'donations' | etc,
      title: 'Short description',
      description: 'Longer explanation with names',
      affectedMembers: problemMembers.map(m => m.tag),
      actionable: 'What leader should do about it',
      metric: 'Optional numeric value',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
  
  return alerts;
}

// 3. Call from generateAlerts()
export function generateAlerts(members: Member[]): Alert[] {
  // ...
  alerts.push(...detectNewIssue(context));
  // ...
}
```

### **3. Zustand Store Pattern:**

```typescript
// Read from store:
const value = useDashboardStore((state) => state.someValue);

// Or use selector:
import { selectors } from '@/lib/stores/dashboard-store';
const value = useDashboardStore(selectors.someSelector);

// Write to store:
const setValue = useDashboardStore((state) => state.setSomeValue);
setValue(newValue);
```

### **4. Component Patterns:**

```typescript
// Always use GlassCard for main sections:
import { GlassCard, Button } from '@/components/ui';

<GlassCard>
  <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-100 mb-4">Title</h2>
  {/* content */}
</GlassCard>

// Use consistent color schemes:
// - Emerald/Green: Positive, success, healthy
// - Red: Critical, urgent, danger
// - Amber/Yellow: Warning, attention needed
// - Blue: Info, neutral actions
// - Slate: Default, muted
```

## 💡 Key Learnings from This Session

1. **User wants actionable intelligence, not generic advice**
   - "What should I do?" beats "Copy this chat message"
   - Specific names and numbers beat vague suggestions
   - Real-time beats stale AI content

2. **Pure data analysis > AI dependency**
   - Deterministic calculations always work
   - No API costs
   - Faster and more reliable
   - Users trust it more

3. **Prioritization matters**
   - High/medium/low classification helps leaders focus
   - Show most critical items first
   - Expandable details for deep dives

4. **Names > Tags always**
   - Player tags (#ABC123) are useless to humans
   - Always show player names in UI
   - Keep tags internal for lookup only

5. **Data freshness is critical**
   - Users need to know if data is current
   - Show "Updated X hours ago" prominently
   - Auto-refresh with nightly ingestion

---

## 📞 Questions for User (If Needed)
