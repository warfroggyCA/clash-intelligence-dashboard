# 2026-02-06

- Recovered session context after thread archive by reloading `SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `memory/2026-02-05.md`, and `MEMORY.md`.
- Confirmed `rg` is installed and available at `/opt/homebrew/bin/rg` (`ripgrep 15.1.0`).
- Shipped roster parity updates in `web-next/src/app/new/roster`:
  - `RosterHeader.tsx`: removed legacy `/new/roster/table` usage in prefetch/links; standardized on `/new/roster?view=cards|table`; replaced TH mix `title` tooltip with shared `Tooltip`.
  - `RosterClient.tsx`: replaced native profile-link `title` with shared `Tooltip` and ARIA label; aligned cards search/filter toolbar spacing/sizing to match table/spec2 controls.
  - `table/ColumnPickerModal.tsx`: replaced native `title` on move buttons with shared `Tooltip`.
  - `table/TableClient.tsx`: fixed `Spec2Input` callback usage (`onChange={setSearch}`).
- Verification:
  - `npm --prefix web-next run lint` passes with no errors.
  - Playwright captures generated in `web-next/output/playwright/roster-parity-2026-02-06/` (cards/table desktop + mobile).
- Remaining gap:
  - Initially hit a transient `/new/ui/roster-spec2` runtime module resolution error tied to stale dev artifacts/manifest state.
  - After recompilation, route renders again and Playwright capture succeeded (`spec2-desktop-postfix.png`).
